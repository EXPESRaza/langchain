(1) This is the Book, there is no doubt in it, a guidance to the Godwary, (2) who believe in \\nthe Unseen, maintain the prayer, and spend out of what We ha ve provided for them; (3) and who \\nbelieve in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, and are certain of the \\nHereafter. (4) Those follow their Lord’s guidance and it is they who are the felicitous. (5) As for the \\nfaithless, it is t he same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not have faith. \\n(6) Allah has set a seal on their hearts and their hearing, and there is a blindfold on their sight, and there \\nis a great punishment for them. (7) Among the people are those who say, ‘We have faith in Allah and the \\nLast Day,’ but they have no faith. (8) They seek to deceive Allah and those who have faith, yet they \\ndeceive no one but themselves, but they are not aware. (9) There is a sickness in their hearts; then Allah \\nincreased their sickness, and there is a painful punishment for them because of the lies they used to tell. \\n(10) When they are told, ‘Do not cause corruption on the earth,’ they say, ‘We are only reformers!’ (11) \\nBehold! They are themselves the agents of corru ption, but they are not aware. (12) And when they are \\ntold, ‘Believe like the people who have believed,’ they say, ‘Shall we believe like the fools who have \\nbelieved?’ Behold! They are themselves the fools, but they do not know. (13) When they meet the \\nfaithful, they say, ‘We believe,’ but when they are alone with their devils, they say, ‘We are with you; we \\nwere only deriding *them+.’ (14) It is Allah who derides them, and leaves them bewildered in their \\nrebellion. (15) They are the ones who bought error f or guidance, so their trade did not profit them, nor \\nwere they guided. (16) Their parable is that of one who lighted a torch, and when it had lit up all around \\nhim, Allah took away their light, and left them sightless in a manifold darkness. (17) Deaf, dum b, and \\nblind, they will not come back. (18) Or that of a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder \\nand lightning: they put their fingers in their ears due to the thunderclaps, apprehensive of death; and \\nAllah besieges the faithless. (19) The lig htning almost snatches away their sight: whenever it shines for \\nthem, they walk in it, and when the darkness falls upon them, they stand. Had Allah willed, He would \\nhave taken away their hearing and sight. Indeed Allah has power over all things. (20) O man kind! \\nWorship your Lord, who created you and those who were before you, so that you may be Godwary (21) \\n—He who made the earth a place of repose for you, and the sky a canopy, and He sends down water \\nfrom the sky and with it brings forth crops for your sus tenance. So do not set up equals to Allah, while \\nyou know. (22) And if you are in doubt concerning what We have sent down to Our servant, then bring a \\nsurah like it, and invoke your helpers besides Allah, if you are truthful. (23) But if you do not —and you \\nwill not—then beware the Fire whose fuel will be humans and stones, prepared for the faithless. (24) \\nAnd give good news to those who have faith and do righteous deeds, that for them shall be gardens with \\nstreams running in them: whenever they are provided  with their fruit for nourishment, they will say, \\n‘This is what we were provided before,’ and they were given something resembling it. There will be \\nchaste mates for them, and they will remain therein [forever]. (25) Indeed Allah is not ashamed to draw \\na parable whether it is that of a gnat or something above it. As for those who have faith, they know it is \\nthe truth from their Lord; and as for the faithless, they say, ‘What did Allah mean by this parable?’ \\nThereby He leads many astray, and thereby He guides many; and He leads no one astray thereby except \\nthe transgressors (26) —those who break the covenant made with Allah after having pledged it \\nsolemnly, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and cause corruption on the earth —it is \\nthey who are t he losers.

(34) We said, ‘O Adam, dwell with your mate in paradise and eat thereof freely \\nwhencesoever you wish, but do not approach this tree, lest you should be among the wrongdoers.’ (35) \\nThen Satan caused them to stumble from it, and he dislodged them from what [state] they were in; and \\nWe said, ‘Get down, being enemies of one another! On the earth shall be your abode and sustenance for \\na time.’ (36) Then Adam received certain words from his Lord, and He turned  to him clemently. Indeed \\nHe is the All -clement, the All -merciful. (37) We said, ‘Get down from it, all together! Yet, should any \\nguidance come to you from Me, those who follow My guidance shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve. \\n(38) But those who are f aithless and deny Our signs, they shall be the inmates of the Fire and they shall \\nremain in it [forever].

(41) Do not mix the truth with falsehood, \\nnor conceal the truth while you know. (42) And maintain the prayer, and give the zakat, and bow along \\nwith those who bow [in prayer].

(44) And tak e recourse in patience and prayer, and it is \\nindeed hard except for the humble (45) —those who are certain that they will encounter their Lord and \\nthat they will return to Him. (46) O Children of Israel, remember My blessing which I bestowed upon \\nyou, and that I gave you an advantage over all the nations. (47) Beware of the day when no soul will \\ncompensate for another, neither any intercession shall be accepted from it, nor any ransom shall be \\nreceived from it, nor will they be helped.

(49) And when We parted the sea with you, and We delivered you \\nand drowned Pharaoh’s clan as you looked on.

So We sent down on those who were wrongdoers a plague from the sky because of the \\ntransgressions they used to commit. (5 9) And when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said, \\n‘Strike the rock with your staff.’ Thereat twelve fountains gushed forth from it; every tribe came to know \\nits drinking -place. ‘Eat and drink of Allah’s provision, and do not act wickedly on the e arth, causing \\ncorruption.’ (60) And when you said, ‘O Moses, ‘We will not put up with one kind of food. So invoke your \\nLord for us, so that He may bring forth for us of that which the earth grows —its greens and cucumbers, \\nits garlic, lentils, and onions.’ He said, ‘Do you seek to replace what is superior with that which is \\ninferior? Go down to any town and you will indeed get what you ask for!’ So they were struck with \\nabasement and poverty, and they earned Allah’s wrath. That, because they would deny the s igns of \\nAllah and kill the prophets unjustly. That, because they would disobey and commit transgressions. (61) \\nIndeed the faithful, the Jews, the Christians and the Sabaeans —those of them who have faith in Allah \\nand the Last Day and act righteously—they shall have their reward from their Lord, and they will have no \\nfear, nor will they grieve. (62) And when We took a pledge from you, and raised the Mount above you, \\n*declaring+, ‘Hold on with power to what We have given you and remember that which is in it so  that \\nyou may be Godwary.’ (63) Again you turned away after that; and were it not for Allah’s grace on you \\nand His mercy, you would have surely been among the losers. (64) And certainly you know those of you \\nwho violated the Sabbath, whereupon We said to t hem, ‘Be you spurned apes.’ (65) So We made it an \\nexemplary punishment for the present and the succeeding [generations], and an advice to the Godwary. \\n(66) And when Moses said to his people, ‘Allah commands you to slaughter a cow,’ they said, ‘Are you \\nmocking us?’ He said, ‘I seek Allah’s protection lest I should be one of the ignorant!’ (67) They said, \\n‘Invoke your Lord for us that He may clarify for us what she may be.’ He said, ‘He says, she is a cow, \\nneither old nor young, of a middle age. Now do what y ou are commanded.’ (68) They said, ‘Invoke your \\nLord for us that He may clarify for us what her colour may be.’ He said, ‘He says, she is a cow that is \\nyellow, of a bright hue, pleasing to the onlookers.’ (69) They said, ‘Invoke your Lord for us that He ma y \\nclarify for us what she may be. Indeed all cows are much alike to us, and if Allah wishes we will surely be \\nguided.’ (70) He said, ‘He says, She is a cow not broken to till the earth or water the tillage, sound and \\nwithout blemish.’ They said, ‘Now have you come up with the truth!’ And they slaughtered it, though \\nthey were about not to do it. (71) And when you killed a soul, and accused one another about it —and \\nAllah was to expose what you were concealing — (72) We said, ‘Strike him with a piece of it:’ th us does \\nAllah revive the dead, and He shows you His signs so that you may exercise your reason.

(88) And when there came to them a Book \\nfrom Allah, confirming that which is with them —and earlier they would pray for victory over the \\npagans—so when there came to them what they recognized, they denied it. So may the curse of Allah \\nbe on the faithless! (89) Evil is that for which they have sold their souls, by defying what Allah has sent \\ndown, out of envy that Allah should bestow His grace on any of His servants that He wishes. Thus, they \\nearned wrath upon wrath, and there is a humiliating punishment for the faithless. (90) And when they \\nare told, ‘Believe in what Allah has sent down,’ they say, ‘We believe in what was sent down to us,’ and \\nthey disbelieve what is besides it, though it is the truth confirming what is with them. Say, ‘Then why \\nwould you kill the prophets of Allah formerly, should you be faithful?’ (91) Certainly Moses brought you \\nmanifest proofs, but then you took up the Calf in his abs ence and you were wrongdoers. (92) And when \\nWe took covenant with you and raised the Mount above you, *declaring+, ‘Hold on with power to what \\nWe have given you, and do listen!’ They said, ‘We hear, and disobey,’ and their hearts had been imbued \\nwith [the love of+ the Calf, due to their unfaith.

(100) And when there  came to them an apostle from Allah, confirming that \\nwhich is with them, a part of those who were given the Book cast the Book of Allah behind their back, as \\nif they did not know *that it is Allah’s Book+. (101) And they followed what the devils pursued du ring \\nSolomon’s reign —and Solomon was not faithless but it was the devils who were faithless —teaching the \\npeople magic and what was sent down to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut, who would not \\nteach anyone without telling *him+, ‘We are only a te st, so do not be faithless.’ But they would learn \\nfrom those two that with which they would cause a split between man and his wife —though they could \\nnot harm anyone with it except with Allah’s leave. They would learn that which would harm them and \\nbring th em no benefit; though they certainly knew that anyone who buys it has no share in the \\nHereafter. Surely, evil is that for which they sold their souls, had they known! (102) Had they been \\nfaithful and Godwary, the reward from Allah would have been better, had they known! (103) O you who \\nhave faith! Do not say Ra‘ina, but say Unzurna, and listen! And there is a painful punishment for the \\nfaithless. (104) Neither the faithless from among the People of the Book nor the idolaters like that any \\ngood be showered on you from your Lord; but Allah singles out for His mercy whomever He wishes, and \\nAllah is dispenser of a mighty grace. (105) For any verse that We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We \\nbring another which is better than it, or similar to it. Do you not kn ow that Allah has power over all \\nthings? (106) Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? And \\nbesides Allah, you do not have any guardian or helper. (107) Would you question your Apostle as Moses \\nwas questioned formerly? Whoever changes faith for unfaith certainly strays from the right way. (108) \\nMany of the People of the Book are eager to turn you into unbelievers after your faith, out of their inner \\nenvy, [and] after the truth had become manifest to them. Yet excuse [t hem] and forbear until Allah \\nissues His edict. Indeed Allah has power over all things. (109) And maintain the prayer and give the \\nzakat. Any good that you send ahead for your own souls, you shall find it with Allah. Indeed Allah \\nwatches what you do. (110) And they say, ‘No one will enter paradise except one who is a Jew or \\nChristian.’ Those are their *false+ hopes! Say, ‘Produce your evidence, should you be truthful.’ (111) \\nCertainly, whoever submits his will to Allah and is virtuous, he shall have his rewa rd from his Lord, and \\nthey will have no fear, nor shall they grieve. (112) The Jews say, ‘The Christians stand on nothing,’ and \\nthe Christians say, ‘The Jews stand on nothing,’ though they follow the *same+ Book. So said those who \\nhad no knowledge, [words]  similar to what they say. Allah will judge between them on the Day of \\nResurrection concerning that about which they used to differ. (113) Who is a greater wrongdoer than \\nthose who deny access to the mosques of Allah lest His Name be celebrated therein, an d try to ruin \\nthem? Such ones may not enter them, except in fear. There is disgrace for them in this world and a great \\npunishment in the Hereafter. (114) To Allah belong the east and the west: so whichever way you turn, \\nthere is the face of Allah! Allah is indeed all-bounteous, all-knowing. (115) And they say, ‘Allah has taken \\na son.’ Immaculate is He! Rather, to Him belongs whatever there is in the heavens and the earth. All are \\nobedient to Him, (116) the Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He de cides on a matter, He \\njust says to it, ‘Be!’ and it is. (117) Those who have no knowledge say, ‘Why does not Allah speak to us, \\nor come to us a sign?’ So said those who were before them, *words+ similar to what they say. Alike are \\ntheir hearts. We have cer tainly made the signs clear for a people who have certainty. (118) Indeed We \\nhave sent you with the truth, as a bearer of good news and as a warner, and you will not be questioned \\nconcerning the inmates of hell. (119) Never will the Jews be pleased with yo u, nor the Christians, unless \\nyou followed their creed. Say, ‘Indeed it is the guidance of Allah which is *true+ guidance.’ And should \\nyou follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you will not have against Allah any'),\n",

(120) Those to whom We have given the Book follow it as it ought to be followed: \\nthey have faith in it. As for those who deny it —it is they who are the losers. (121) O Children of Israel, \\nremember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and that I gave yo u an advantage over all the \\nnations. (122) Beware of the Day when no soul will compensate for another, neither will any ransom be \\naccepted from it, nor will any intercession benefit it, nor will they be helped. (123) When his Lord tested \\nAbraham with certain words and he fulfilled them, He said, ‘I am making you the Imam of mankind.’ Said \\nhe, ‘And from among my descendants?’ He said, ‘My pledge does not extend to the unjust.’ (124) And \\n[remember] when We made the House a place of reward for mankind and a sanctuary, *declaring+, ‘Take \\nthe venue of prayer from Abraham’s Station.’ We charged Abraham and Ishmael *with its upkeep, \\nsaying+, ‘Purify My House for those who go around it, *for+ those who make it a retreat and *for+ those \\nwho bow and prostrate.’ (125) And when Abraham said, ‘My Lord, make this a secure town, and provide \\nits people with fruits—such of them as have faith in Allah and the Last Day,’ He said, ‘As for him who is \\nfaithless, I will provide for him [too] for a short time, then I will shove him toward the punishment of the \\nFire and it is an evil destination.’ (126) As Abraham raised the foundations of the House with Ishmael, \\n*they prayed+: ‘Our Lord, accept it from us! Indeed You are the All -hearing, the All-knowing. (127) ‘Our \\nLord, make us submissive to You, and [raise] from our progeny a nation submissive to You, and show us \\nour rites [of worship], and turn to us clemently. Indeed You are the All -clement, the All-merciful.’ (128) \\n‘Our Lord, raise amongst them an apostle from among them, who wil l recite to them Your signs and \\nteach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. Indeed You are the All -mighty, the All -wise.’ (129) \\nAnd who will *ever+ forsake Abraham’s creed except one who debases himself? We certainly chose him \\nin the [present] world, and in the Hereafter he will indeed be among the Righteous. (130) When his Lord \\nsaid to him, ‘Submit,’ he said, ‘I submit to the Lord of all the worlds.’ (131) Abraham enjoined this \\n*creed+ upon his children, and *so did+ Jacob, *saying+, ‘My children! Allah has indeed chosen this religion \\nfor you; so do not die except as those who have surrendered themselves [to Allah]. (132) Were you \\nwitnesses when death approached Jacob, when he said to his children, ‘What will you worship after \\nme?’ They said, ‘We will w orship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac, \\nthe One God, and to Him do we submit.’ (133) That was a nation that has passed: for it there will be \\nwhat it has earned, and for you there will be what you have earned, and you will not be questioned \\nabout what they used to do. (134) They say, ‘Be either Jews or Christians, that you may be *rightly+ \\nguided.’ Say, ‘No, rather, *we will follow+ the creed of Abraham, a Hanif, and he was not one of the \\npolytheists.’ (135) Say, ‘We have fa ith in Allah and what has been sent down to us, and what was sent \\ndown to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus were given, and \\nthat which the prophets were given from their Lord; we make no distinction between any o f them and \\nto Him do we submit.’ (136) So if they believe in the like of what you believe in, then they are surely \\nguided; but if they turn away, then [know that] they are only [steeped] in defiance. Allah will suffice you \\nagainst them, and He is the All -hearing, the All-knowing. (137) ‘The baptism of Allah, and who baptizes \\nbetter than Allah? And Him do we worship.’ (138) Say, ‘Will you argue with us concerning Allah, while He \\nis our Lord and your Lord, and to us belong our deeds, and to you belong your de eds, and we worship \\nHim dedicatedly?’ (139) *Ask them,+ ‘Do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes \\nwere Jews or Christians?’ Say, ‘Is it you who know better, or Allah?’ And who is a greater wrongdoer \\nthan someone who conceals a testimo ny that is with him from Allah? And Allah is not oblivious of what \\nyou do.

He guides whomever He wishes to a straight path.’ (142) \\nThus We have made you a middle nation that you may be witnesses to the people, and that the Apostle \\nmay be a witness to you. We did not appoint the qiblah you were following, but that We may ascertain \\nthose who follow the Apostle from those who turn back on their heels. It was indeed a hard thing except \\nfor those whom Allah has guided. And Allah would not let your prayers go to waste. Indeed Allah is most \\nkind and merciful to mankind. (143) We certainly see you turning your face about in the sky. We will \\nsurely turn you to a qiblah of your lik ing: so turn your face towards the Holy Mosque, and wherever you \\nmay be, turn your faces towards it! Indeed those who were given the Book surely know that it is the \\ntruth from their Lord. And Allah is not oblivious of what they do. (144) Even if you bring those who were \\ngiven the Book every [kind of] sign, they will not follow your qiblah. Nor shall you follow their qiblah, nor \\nwill any of them follow the qiblah of the other. And if you follow their desires, after the knowledge that \\nhas come to you, you wil l be one of the wrongdoers. (145) Those whom We have given the Book \\nrecognize him just as they recognize their sons, but a part of them indeed conceal the truth while they \\nknow. (146) This is the truth from your Lord; so do not be among the skeptics. (147)  Everyone has a \\ncynosure to which he turns; so take the lead in all good works. Wherever you may be, Allah will bring \\nyou all together. Indeed Allah has power over all things. (148) Whencesoever you may go out, turn your \\nface towards the Holy Mosque. Indee d it is the truth from your Lord, and Allah is not oblivious of what \\nyou do. (149) And whencesoever you may go out, turn your face towards the Holy Mosque, and \\nwherever you may be, turn your faces towards it, so that the people may have no allegation against you, \\nneither those of them who are wrongdoers. So do not fear them, but fear Me, that I may complete My \\nblessing on you and so that you may be guided. (150) Even as We sent to you an apostle from among \\nyourselves, who recites to you Our signs and purifi es you, and teaches you the Book and wisdom, and \\nteaches you what you did not know. (151) Remember Me and I will remember you, and thank Me, and \\ndo not be ungrateful to Me. (152) O you who have faith! Take recourse in patience and prayer; indeed \\nAllah is with the patient. (153) Do not call those who were slain in Allah’s way ‘dead.’ No, they are living, \\nbut you are not aware. (154) We will surely test you with a measure of fear and hunger and a loss of \\nwealth, lives, and fruits; and give good news to the pa tient (155) —those who, when an affliction visits \\nthem, say, ‘Indeed we belong to Allah and to Him do we indeed return.’ (156) It is they who receive the \\nblessings of their Lord and [His] mercy, and it is they who are the [rightly] guided. (157) Indeed Saf a and \\nMarwah are among Allah’s sacraments. So whoever makes hajj to the House, or performs the ‘umrah, \\nthere is no sin upon him to circuit between them. Should anyone do good of his own accord, then Allah \\nis indeed appreciative, all -knowing. (158) Indeed t hose who conceal what We have sent down of \\nmanifest proofs and guidance, after We have clarified it in the Book for mankind —they shall be cursed \\nby Allah and cursed by the cursers, (159) except such as repent, make amends, and clarify —those I shall \\npardon, and I am the All -clement, the All-merciful. (160) Indeed those who turn faithless and die while \\nthey are faithless—it is they on whom shall be the curse of Allah, the angels and all mankind. (161) They \\nwill remain in it [forever] and their punishment shal l not be lightened, nor will they be granted any \\nrespite. (162) Your god is the One God; there is no god except Him, the All -beneficent, the All-merciful. \\n(163) Indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day, and the \\nships that sail at sea with profit to men, and the water that Allah sends down from the sky —with which \\nHe revives the earth after its death, and scatters therein every kind of animal —and the changing of the \\nwinds, and the clouds disposed between the sk y and the earth, there are surely signs for a people who \\nexercise their reason.

(169) When they are told, ‘ Follow what Allah has sent down,’ they say, ‘No, We \\nwill follow what we have found our fathers following.’ What, even if their fathers neither exercised their \\nreason nor were guided?! (170) The parable of the faithless is that of someone who shouts after t hat \\nwhich does not hear [anything] except a call and cry: deaf, dumb, and blind, they do not exercise their \\nreason. (171) O you who have faith! Eat of the good things We have provided you, and thank Allah, if it \\nis Him that you worship. (172) He has forbidden you only carrion, blood, the flesh of the swine, and that \\nwhich has been offered to other than Allah. But should someone be compelled, without being rebellious \\nor transgressive, there shall be no sin upon him. Indeed Allah is all -forgiving, all-merciful. (173) Indeed \\nthose who conceal what Allah has sent down of the Book and sell it for a paltry gain —they do not take \\nin, into their bellies, [anything] except fire, and Allah shall not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, \\nnor shall He purify them, an d there is a painful punishment for them. (174) They are the ones who \\nbought error for guidance, and punishment for pardon: how patient of them to face the Fire! (175) That \\nis so because Allah has sent down the Book with the truth, and those who differ abo ut the Book are \\nsurely in extreme defiance. (176) Piety is not to turn your faces to the east or the west; rather, piety is \\n[personified by] those who have faith in Allah and the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets, \\nand who give their wealth, for the love of Him, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveller and the \\nbeggar, and for [the freeing of] the slaves, and maintain the prayer and give the zakat, and those who \\nfulfill their covenants, when they pledge themselves, and those who are pati ent in stress and distress, \\nand in the heat of battle. They are the ones who are true [to their covenant], and it is they who are the \\nGodwary. (177) O you who have faith! Retribution is prescribed for you regarding the slain: freeman for \\nfreeman, slave for slave, and female for female. But if one is granted any extenuation by his brother, let \\nthe follow up [for the blood -money] be honourable, and let the payment to him be with kindness. That \\nis a remission from your Lord and a mercy; and should anyone trans gress after that, there shall be a \\npainful punishment for him. (178) There is life for you in retribution, O you who possess intellects! \\nMaybe you will be Godwary! (179) Prescribed for you, when death approaches any of you and he leaves \\nbehind any property, is that he make a bequest for his parents and relatives, in an honourable manner—\\nan obligation on the Godwary. (180) And should anyone alter it after hearing it, its sin shall indeed lie on \\nthose who alter it. Indeed Allah is all -hearing, all-knowing. (181) But should someone, fearing deviance \\nor sin on the testator’s behalf, set things right between them, there is no sin upon him. Indeed Allah is \\nall-forgiving, all-merciful. (182) O you who have faith! Prescribed for you is fasting as it was prescribed \\nfor those who were before you, so that you may be Godwary. (183) That for known days. But should any \\nof you be sick or on a journey, let it be a [similar] number of other days. Those who find it straining shall \\nbe liable to atonement by feeding a needy pers on. Should anyone do good of his own accord, that is \\nbetter for him, and to fast is better for you, should you know. (184) The month of Rama¤¡n is one in \\nwhich the Quran was sent down as guidance to mankind, with manifest proofs of guidance and the \\nCriterion.

So let them respond to Me, and let them have faith in Me, so that \\nthey may fare rightly. (186) You are permitted on the night of the fast to go into your wives: they are a \\ngarment for you, and you are a garment for them.

Then complete the fast until nightfall, and do not consort with them while you dwell in \\nconfinement in the mosques. These are Allah’s bounds, so do not approach them. Thus does Allah clarify \\nHis signs for mankind so that they may be Godwary. (187) Do not eat up your wealth among yourselves \\nwrongfully, nor proffer it to the judges in order to eat up a part of the people’s wealth sinfully, while you \\nknow *that it is immoral to do so+. (188) They question you concerning the new moons.

(189) Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you, but \\ndo not transgress. Indeed Allah does not like tran sgressors. (190) And kill them wherever you confront \\nthem, and expel them from where they expelled you, for persecution is graver than killing. But do not \\nfight them near the Holy Mosque unless they fight you therein; but if they fight you, kill them; such  is \\nthe requital of the faithless. (191) But if they desist, then Allah is indeed all -forgiving, all-merciful. (192) \\nFight them until persecution is no more, and religion becomes [exclusively] for Allah. Then if they desist, \\nthere shall be no reprisal exce pt against the wrongdoers. (193) A sacred month for a sacred month, and \\nall sanctities require retribution. So should anyone aggress against you, assail him in the manner he \\nassailed you, and be wary of Allah, and know that Allah is with the Godwary. (194)  Spend in the way of \\nAllah, and do not cast yourselves with your own hands into destruction; and be virtuous. Indeed Allah \\nloves the virtuous. (195) Complete the hajj and the ‘umrah for Allah’s sake, and if you are prevented, \\nthen [make] such [sacrificial]  offering as is feasible. And do not shave your heads until the offering \\nreaches its [assigned] place. But should any of you be sick, or have a hurt in his head, let the atonement \\nbe by fasting, or charity, or sacrifice. And when you have security —for those who enjoy [release from \\nthe restrictions+ by virtue of their ‘umrah until the hajj —let the offering be such as is feasible. As for \\nsomeone who cannot afford [the offering], let him fast three days during the hajj and seven when you \\nreturn; that is [a period of] ten complete [days]. That is for someone whose family does not dwell by the \\nHoly Mosque. And be wary of Allah, and know that Allah is severe in retribution. (196) The hajj [season] \\nis in months well-known; so whoever decides on hajj [pilgrimage] therein, [should know that] there is to \\nbe no sexual contact, vicious talk, or disputing during the hajj. And whatever good you do, Allah knows \\nit. And take provision, for indeed the best provision is Godwariness. So be wary of Me, O you who \\npossess intellects!

Then Allah guided those who had faith to the truth of what they differed in, by \\nHis will, and Allah guides whomev er He wishes to a straight path.

Yet it may be that you dislike something, which is \\ngood for you, and it may be that you love something, which is bad for you, and Allah kno ws and you do \\nnot know.

(221) They ask you concerning \\n*intercourse during+ menses. Say, ‘It is hurtful.’ So keep away from wives during the menses, and do not \\napproach them till they are clean. And when they become clean, go into them as Allah has commanded \\nyou. Indeed Allah loves the penitent and He loves those who keep clean. (222) Your women are a tillage \\nfor you, so come to your tillage whenever you like, and send ahead for your souls, and be Godwary, and \\nknow that you will encounter Him; and give good news to the faithful.

(227) Divo rced women shall wait by themselves for three \\nperiods of purity [after menses], and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their \\nwombs if they believe in Allah and the Last Day; and their husbands have a greater right to restore them \\nduring this [duration], if they desire reconcilement. The wives have rights similar to the obligations upon \\nthem, in accordance with honourable norms; and men have a degree above them, and Allah is all -\\nmighty and all -wise. (228) [Revocable] divorce may b e only twice; then [let there be] either an \\nhonourable retention, or a kindly release. It is not lawful for you to take back anything from what you \\nhave given them, unless the couple fear that they may not maintain Allah’s bounds; so if you fear they \\nwould not maintain Allah’s bounds, there is no sin upon them in what she may give to secure her own \\nrelease. These are Allah’s bounds, so do not transgress them, and whoever transgresses the bounds of \\nAllah—it is they who are the wrongdoers. (229) And if he div orces her, she will not be lawful for him \\nthereafter until she marries a husband other than him, and if he divorces her, there is no sin upon them \\nto remarry if they think that they can maintain Allah’s bounds. These are Allah’s bounds, which He \\nclarifies for a people who have knowledge. (230) When you divorce women and they complete their \\nterm [of waiting], then either retain them honourably or release them honourably, and do not retain \\nthem maliciously in order that you may transgress; and whoever does th at certainly wrongs himself. Do \\nnot take the signs of Allah in derision, and remember Allah’s blessing upon you, and what He has sent \\ndown to you of the Book and wisdom, to advise you therewith.

(241) Thus does Allah clarify His signs to you so that you may exercise \\nyour reason. (242) Have you not regarded those who left their homes in thousands, apprehensive of \\ndeath, whereupon Allah said to them, ‘Die,’ then He revived them? Indeed Allah is gracious to mankind, \\nbut most people do not give thanks. (243) Fight in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is all -hearing, \\nall-knowing. (244) Who is it that will lend Allah a good loan that He may m ultiply it for him severalfold? \\nAllah tightens and expands [the means of life], and to Him you shall be brought back. (245) Have you not \\nregarded the elite of the Israelites after Moses, when they said to their prophet, ‘Appoint for us a king \\nthat we may f ight in the way of Allah.’ He said, ‘May it not be that you will not fight if fighting were \\nprescribed for you?’ They said, ‘Why should we not fight in the way of Allah, when we have been \\nexpelled from our homes and *separated from+ our children?’ So when fighting was prescribed for them, \\nthey turned back except a few of them, and Allah knows well the wrongdoers. (246) Their prophet said \\nto them, ‘Allah has appointed Saul as king for you.’ They said, ‘How can he have kingship over us, when \\nwe have a greater right to kingship than him, as he has not been given ample wealth?’ He said, ‘Indeed \\nAllah has chosen him over you, and enhanced him vastly in knowledge and physique, and Allah gives His \\nkingdom to whomever He wishes, and Allah is all -bounteous, all-knowing.’ (247) Their prophet said to \\nthem, ‘Indeed the sign of his kingship shall be that the Ark will come to you, bearing tranquillity from \\nyour Lord and the relics left behind by the House of Moses and the House of Aaron, borne by the angels. \\nThere is indee d a sign in that for you, should you be faithful.’ (248) As Saul set out with the troops, he \\nsaid, ‘Allah will test you with a stream: anyone who drinks from it will not belong to me, but those who \\ndo not drink from it will belong to me, barring someone wh o draws a scoop with his hand.’ But they \\ndrank from it, [all] except a few of them. So when he crossed it along with the faithful who were with \\nhim, they said, ‘We have no strength today against Goliath and his troops.’ Those who were certain that \\nthey would encounter Allah said, ‘How many a small party has overcome a larger party by Allah’s will! \\nAnd Allah is with the patient.’ (249) So when they marched out for *encounter with+ Goliath and his \\ntroops, they said, ‘Our Lord, pour patience upon us, make our feet steady, and assist us against the'),\n",

Were it not for Allah’s repelling the people by \\nmeans of one another, the earth would surely have been corrupted; but Allah is gracious to the world’s \\npeople. (251) These are the signs of Allah, which We recite for you in truth, and you are indeed one of \\nthe apostles. (252) These are the apostles, some of whom We gave an advantage over others: of them \\nare those to whom Allah spoke and some of them He raised in rank, and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, \\nmanifest proofs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Had Allah wished, those who succeeded \\nthem would not have  fought one another after the manifest proofs had come to them. But they \\ndiffered. So there were among them those who had faith and there were among them those who were \\nfaithless, and had Allah wished, they would not have fought one another; but Allah does  whatever He \\ndesires. (253) O you who have faith! Spend out of what We have provided you before there comes a day \\non which there will be no bargaining, neither friendship, nor intercession. And the faithless —they are \\nthe wrongdoers. (254) Allah —there is no  god except Him —is the Living One, the All -sustainer. Neither \\ndrowsiness befalls Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the \\nearth. Who is it that may intercede with Him except with His permission? He knows what is before them \\nand what is behind them, and they do not comprehend anything of His knowledge except what He \\nwishes. His seat embraces the heavens and the earth and He is not wearied by their preservation, and \\nHe is the All -exalted, the All -supreme. (255) There is no compulsion in religion: rectitude has become \\ndistinct from error. So one who disavows fake deities and has faith in Allah has held fast to the firmest \\nhandle for which there is no breaking; and Allah is all -hearing, all-knowing. (256) Allah is the wali of the \\nfaithful: He brings them out of darkness into light. As for the faithless, their awliya are the fake deities, \\nwho drive them out of light into darkness. They shall be the inmates of the Fire, and they will remain in \\nit [forever]. (257) Have you not regarded him who argued with Abraham about his Lord, [only] because \\nAllah had given him kingdom? When Abraham said, ‘My Lord is He who gives life and brings death,’ he \\nreplied, ‘I *too+ give life and bring death.’ Abraham said, ‘Indeed Allah brings the sun  from the east; now \\nyou bring it from the west.’ Thereat the faithless one was dumbfounded. And Allah does not guide the \\nwrongdoing lot. (258) Or him who came upon a township as it lay fallen on its trellises. He said, ‘How will \\nAllah revive this after its  death?!’ So Allah made him die for a hundred years, then He resurrected him. \\nHe said, ‘How long did you remain?’ Said he, ‘I have remained a day or part of a day.’ He said, ‘No, you \\nhave remained a hundred years. Now look at your food and drink which have  not rotted! Then look at \\nyour ass! [This was done] that We may make you a sign for mankind. And now look at its bones, how We \\nraise them up and clothe them with flesh!’ When it became evident to him, he said, ‘I know that Allah \\nhas power over all things.’ (259) And when Abraham said, ‘My Lord! Show me how You revive the dead,’ \\nHe said, ‘Do you not believe?’ He said, ‘Yes indeed, but in order that my heart may be at rest.’ He said, \\n‘Catch four of the birds. Then cut them into pieces, and place a part of the m on every mountain, then \\ncall them; they will come to you hastening. And know that Allah is all -mighty and all -wise.’ (260) The \\nparable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is that of a grain which grows seven ears, in \\nevery ear a hundred grains. Allah enhances severalfold whomever He wishes, and Allah is all-bounteous, \\nall-knowing. (261) Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah and then do not follow up what \\nthey have spent with reproaches and affronts, they shall have their reward near their Lord, and they will \\nhave no fear, nor will they grieve. (262) An honourable reply [in response to the needy] and forgiving \\n[their annoyance] is better than a charity followed by affront. Allah is all -sufficient, most forbearing. \\n(263) O you who have faith!

Thus does Allah clarify His signs for you so that you may reflect. (266) O you who \\nhave faith! Spend of the good things you have earned [through trade and the like] and of what We bring \\nforth for you from the earth, and do not be of the mind to give the bad part of it, for you yourselves \\nwould not take it, unless you ignore. An d know that Allah is all -sufficient, all -laudable. (267) Satan \\nfrightens you of poverty and prompts you to [commit] indecent acts. But Allah promises you His \\nforgiveness and bounty, and Allah is all -bounteous, all-knowing. (268) He grants wisdom to whomeve r \\nHe wishes, and he, who is given wisdom, is certainly given an abundant good, and none takes \\nadmonition except those who possess intellect. (269) Allah indeed knows whatever charity you may \\ngive, or vows that you may vow, and the wrongdoers have no helper s. (270) If you disclose your \\ncharities, that is well, but if you hide them and give them to the poor, that is better for you, and it will \\natone for some of your misdeeds, and Allah is well aware of what you do. (271) It is not up to you to \\nguide them; rat her, it is Allah who guides whomever He wishes. Whatever wealth you spend, it is for \\nyour own benefit, as you do not spend but to seek Allah’s pleasure, and whatever wealth you spend will \\nbe repaid to you in full and you will not be wronged. (272) [The cha rities are] for the poor who are \\nstraitened in the way of Allah, not capable of moving about in the land [for trade]. The unaware suppose \\nthem to be well -off because of their reserve. You recognize them by their mark; they do not ask the \\npeople importunately. And whatever wealth you may spend, Allah indeed knows it. (273) Those who \\ngive their wealth by night and day, secretly and openly, they shall have their reward near their Lord, and \\nthey will have no fear, nor will they grieve. (274) Those who exact usu ry will not stand but like one \\nderanged by the Devil’s touch. That is because they say, ‘Trade is just like usury.’ While Allah has \\nallowed trade and forbidden usury. Whoever relinquishes [usury] on receiving advice from his Lord shall \\nkeep [the gains of] what is past, and his matter will rest with Allah. As for those who resume, they shall \\nbe the inmates of the Fire and they shall remain in it [forever]. (275) Allah brings usury to naught, but He \\nmakes charities flourish. Allah does not like any sinful ing rate.

Indeed, there is a severe punishment for those who deny the signs of Allah, and Allah is all -\\nmighty, avenger. (4) Nothing is indeed hidden from Allah in the earth or in the sky. (5) It is He who forms \\nyou in the wombs [of your mothers] however He wishes. There is no god except Him, the All-mighty, the \\nAll-wise. (6) It is He who has sent down to you the Book. Parts of it are definitive verses, which are the \\nmother of the Book, while others are metaphorical. As  for those in whose hearts is deviance, they \\npursue what is metaphorical in it, courting temptation, and seeking its interpretation. But no one knows \\nits interpretation except Allah and those firmly grounded in knowledge; they say, ‘We believe in it; all o f \\nit is from our Lord.’ And none takes admonition except those who possess intellect.

You will  indeed gather mankind on a day in which there is no \\ndoubt. Indeed Allah does not break His promise.’ (9) As for the faithless, neither their wealth nor their \\nchildren shall avail them anything against Allah; it is they who will be fuel for the Fire; (10) as in the case \\nof Pharaoh’s clan and those who were before them, who denied Our signs. So Allah seized them for their \\nsins, and Allah is severe in retribution. (11) Say to the faithless, ‘You shall be overcome and mustered \\ntoward hell, and it is an evil re sting place.’ (12) There was certainly a sign for you in the two hosts that \\nmet: one host fighting in the way of Allah and the other faithless, who saw them as visibly twice as \\nmany.

For those who are Godwary there will \\nbe gardens near their Lord, with streams running in them, to remain in them [for ever], and chaste \\nmates, and Allah’s pleasure.’ And Allah watches His servants.

(25) Say, ‘O Allah, Master of all \\nsovereignty! You give sovereignty to whomever You wish, and strip of sovereignty w homever You wish; \\nYou make mighty whomever You wish, and You degrade whomever You wish; all choice is in Your hand. \\nIndeed You have power over all things.’ (26) ‘You make the night pass into the day and You make the \\nday pass into the night. You bring forth  the living from the dead and You bring forth the dead from the \\nliving, and You provide for whomever You wish without any reckoning.’ (27) The faithful should not take \\nthe faithless for allies instead of the faithful, and Allah will have nothing to do with  those who do that, \\nexcept when you are wary of them, out of caution. Allah warns you to beware of [disobeying] Him, and \\ntoward Allah is the return. (28) Say, ‘Whether you hide what is in your hearts or disclose it, Allah knows \\nit, and He knows whatever th ere is in the heavens and whatever there is in the earth; and Allah has \\npower over all things.’ (29) The day when every soul will find present whatever good it has done; and as \\nfor the evil, it has done, it will wish there were a far distance between it an d itself. Allah warns you to \\nbeware of *disobeying+ Him, and Allah is most kind to *His+ servants. (30) Say, ‘If you love Allah, then \\nfollow me; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins, and Allah is all -forgiving, all-merciful.’ (31) Say, \\n‘Obey Allah and the Apostle.’ But if they turn away, indeed Allah does not like the faithless. (32) Indeed \\nAllah chose Adam and Noah, and the progeny of Abraham and the progeny of Imran above all the \\nnations; (33) some of them are descendants of the others, and Allah  is all -hearing, all -knowing. (34) \\nWhen the wife of Imran said, ‘My Lord, I dedicate to You in consecration what is in my belly. Accept it \\nfrom me; indeed You are the All-hearing, the All-knowing.’ (35) When she bore her, she said, ‘My Lord, I \\nhave borne a  female *child+’ —and Allah knew better what she had borne, and the male [child she \\nexpected] was no match for the female [child she had borne] —‘and I have named her Mary, and I \\ncommend her and her offspring to Your care against [the evil of] the outcast S atan.’ (36) Thereupon her \\nLord accepted her with a gracious acceptance, and made her grow up in a worthy fashion, and He \\ncharged Zechariah with her care. Whenever Zechariah visited her in the sanctuary, he would find \\nprovisions with her. He said, ‘O Mary, from where does this come for you?’ She said, ‘It comes from \\nAllah. Allah provides whomever He wishes without any reckoning.’ (37) Thereat Zechariah supplicated \\nhis Lord. He said, ‘My Lord! Grant me a good offspring from You! Indeed You hear all supplicati ons.’ (38) \\nThen, as he stood praying in the sanctuary the angels called out to him: ‘Allah gives you the good news \\nof John, as a confirmer of a Word of Allah, eminent and chaste, a prophet, and one of the righteous.’ \\n(39) He said, ‘My Lord, how shall I hav e a son while old age has overtaken me and my wife is barren?’ \\nSaid He, ‘So it is that Allah does whatever He wishes.’ (40) He said, ‘My Lord, grant me a sign.’ Said He, \\n‘Your sign is that you will not speak to people for three days except in gestures. Rem ember Your Lord \\nmuch, and glorify Him morning and evening.’ (41) And when the angels said, ‘O Mary, Allah has chosen \\nyou and purified you, and He has chosen you above the world’s women.

I have brought you a sign \\nfrom your Lord; so be wary of Allah and obey me. (50) Indeed Allah is my Lord and your Lord; so worship \\nHim.

We have faith in \\nAllah, and you be witness that we have submitted [to Him]. (52) Our Lord, we believe in what You have \\nsent down, and we follow the apostle, so write us among the witnesses.’ (53) Then they plotted *against \\nJesus], and Allah al so devised, and Allah is the best of devisers. (54) When Allah said, ‘O Jesus, I shall \\ntake you[r soul], and I shall raise you up toward Myself, and I shall clear you of [the calumnies of] the \\nfaithless, and I shall set those who follow you above the faith less until the Day of Resurrection.

(59) This is the truth from your \\nLord, so do not be among the skeptics. (60) Should anyone argue with you concerning him, after the \\nknowledge that has come to you, say, ‘Come! Let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your \\nwomen, our souls and your souls, then let us pray earnestly, and call down Allah’s curse upon the liars.’ \\n(61) This is indeed the true account, for sure. There is n o god but Allah, and indeed Allah is the All -\\nmighty, the All-wise. (62) But if they turn away, indeed Allah knows best the agents of corruption. (63) \\nSay, ‘O People of the Book! Come to a common word between us and you: that we will worship no one \\nbut Allah, that we will not ascribe any partner to Him, and that some of us will not take some others as \\nlords besides Allah.’ But if they turn away, say, ‘Be witnesses that we have submitted *to Allah+.’ (64) O \\nPeople of the Book! Why do you argue concerning Abra ham? Neither the Torah nor the Evangel were \\nsent down until [long] after him. Do you not exercise your reason? (65) Ah! You are the very ones who \\nargue about that of which you have knowledge. But why do you argue about that of which you have no \\nknowledge? And Allah knows and you do not know.

That is because they say, ‘We have no obligation to the \\nnon-Jews.’ But they attribute lies to Allah, and they know *it+.

(76) There shall be no share in the Hereafter for \\nthose who sell Allah’s covenant and their oaths for a paltry gain, and on the Day of Resurrection Allah \\nwill not speak to them nor will He [so much as] look at them, nor will He purify them, and there is a \\npainful punishment for them. (77) There is a group of them who alter their voice while reading out a text \\n[that they have themselves authored], so that you may suppose it to be from the Book, though it is not \\nfrom the Book, and they say, ‘It is from Allah,’ though it is not from Allah, and they attribute lies to Allah, \\nand they know [it]. (78) It does not behoove any human that Allah should give him the Book, judgement \\nand prophethood, and then he should say to the people, ‘Be my servants instead  of Allah.’ Rather *he \\nwould say+, ‘Be a godly people, because of your teaching the Book and because of your studying it.’ (79) \\nAnd he would not command you to take the angels and the prophets for lords. Would he call you to \\nunfaith after you have submitte d [to Allah]? (80) When Allah took a compact concerning the prophets, \\n*He said,+ ‘Inasmuch as I have given you *the knowledge+ of the Book and wisdom, should an apostle \\ncome to you thereafter confirming what is with you, you shall believe in him and help h im.’ He said, ‘Do \\nyou pledge and accept My covenant on this condition?’ They said, ‘We pledge.’ He said, ‘Then be \\nwitnesses, and I, too, am among the witnesses along with you.’ (81) Then whoever turns away after \\nthat—it is they who are the transgressors. ( 82) Do they seek a religion other than that of Allah, while to \\nHim submits whoever there is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will \\nbe brought back? (83) Say, ‘We have faith in Allah and in what has been sent down to us , and what was \\nsent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, and that which Moses, Jesus and the \\nprophets were given by their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him do we \\nsubmit.’ (84) Should anyone follow a religion oth er than Islam, it shall never be accepted from him, and \\nhe will be among the losers in the Hereafter. (85) How shall Allah guide a people who have disbelieved \\nafter their faith and [after] bearing witness that the Apostle is true, and [after] manifest proo fs had \\ncome to them? Allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot. (86) Their requital is that there shall be upon \\nthem the curse of Allah, the angels, and all mankind. (87) They will remain in it [forever], and their \\npunishment will not be lightened, nor will they be granted any respite, (88) except such as repent after \\nthat and make amends, for Allah is all -forgiving, all-merciful. (89) Indeed those who turn faithless after \\ntheir faith, and then advance in faithlessness, their repentance will never be accepted, and it is they who \\nare the astray. (90) Indeed those who turn faithless and die while they are faithless, a world of gold will \\nnot be accepted from any of them should he offer it for ransom. For such there will be a painful \\npunishment, and they will have  no helpers. (91) You will never attain piety until you spend out of what \\nyou hold dear, and whatever you may spend of anything, Allah indeed knows it. (92) All food was lawful \\nto the Children of Israel except what Israel had forbidden himself before the T orah was sent down. Say, \\n‘Bring the Torah, and read it, if you are truthful.’ (93) So whoever fabricates a lie against Allah after \\nthat—it is they who are the wrongdoers.

And you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, whereat He saved you from it. Thus does Allah clarify \\nHis signs f or you so that you may be guided. (103) There has to be a nation among you summoning to \\nthe good, bidding what is right, and forbidding what is wrong. It is they who are the felicitous. (104) Do \\nnot be like those who became divided [into sects] and differe d after manifest signs had come to them. \\nFor such there will be a great punishment (105) on the day when [some] faces will turn white and \\n*some+ faces will turn black. As for those whose faces turn black *it will be said to them+, ‘Did you \\ndisbelieve after your faith? So taste the punishment because of what you used to disbelieve.’ (106) But \\nas for those whose faces become white, they shall dwell in Allah’s mercy, and they will remain in it \\n[forever]. (107) These are the signs of Allah, which We recite to y ou in truth, and Allah does not desire \\nany wrong for the creatures.

(109) You are the best nation [ever] brought forth for mankind: you bid \\nwhat i s right and forbid what is wrong, and have faith in Allah. And if the People of the Book had \\nbelieved, it would have been better for them. Among them [some] are faithful, but most of them are \\ntransgressors. (110) They will never do you any harm, except for  some hurt; and if they fight you, they \\nwill turn their backs [to flee], then they will not be helped. (111) Wherever they are found, abasement is \\nstamped upon them, except for an asylum from Allah and an asylum from the people. They have earned \\nthe wrath of Allah, and poverty has been stamped upon them. That, because they would deny the signs \\nof Allah and kill the prophets unjustly. That, because they would disobey and commit transgression. \\n(112) Yet they are not all alike. Among the People of the Book is an upright nation; they recite Allah’s \\nsigns in the watches of the night and prostrate. (113) They have faith in Allah and the Last Day, and bid \\nwhat is right and forbid what is wrong, and they are active in [performing] good deeds. Those are among \\nthe righteous. (114) Whatever good they do, they will not go unappreciated for it, and Allah knows well \\nthe Godwary.

Allah does not wrong them, but they wrong themselves. (117) O you who \\nhave faith! Do not take your confidants from others than yourselves; they will spare nothing to ruin you. \\nThey are eager to see you in distress.

(163) Allah certainly favoured the faithful when He raised up among them an apostle from \\namong themselves to recite to them His signs and to purify them and teach them the Book and wis dom, \\nand earlier they had indeed been in manifest error. (164) What, when an affliction visits you —while you \\nhave inflicted twice as much—do you say, ‘How is this?’! Say, ‘This is from your own souls.’ Indeed Allah \\nhas power over all things. (165) What bef ell you on the day when the two hosts met, was by Allah’s \\npermission, so that He may ascertain the faithful, (166) and ascertain the hypocrites. [When] they were \\ntold: ‘Come, fight in the way of Allah, or defend *yourselves+, they said, ‘If we knew any fig hting, we \\nwould have surely followed you.’ That day they were nearer to unfaith than to faith. They say with their \\nmouths what is not in their hearts, and Allah knows well whatever they conceal. (167) Those who said of \\ntheir brethren, while they themselves  sat back: ‘Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed.’ \\nSay, ‘Then keep death off from yourselves, if you are truthful.’ (168) Do not suppose those who were \\nslain in the way of Allah to be dead; no, they are living and provided for near their Lord, (169) exulting in \\nwhat Allah has given them out of His grace, and rejoicing for those who have not yet joined them from'),\n",

(181) That is because of what your hands have sent ahead, \\nand because Allah is not tyrannical to His servants.’ (182) Tell those who say, ‘Allah has pledged us not \\nto believe in any apostle unless he brings us an offering consumed by fire,’ ‘Apostles before me certainly \\ndid bring you manifest signs and what you speak of. Then why did you kill them, if you are truthful?’ \\n(183) But if they deny you, [other] apostles have been denied before you, who came with manifest signs, \\nholy writs, and an illuminating scripture. (184) Every soul shall taste death, and you will indeed be paid \\nyour full rewards on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is delivered from the Fire and admitted to \\nparadise has certainly succeeded. The l ife of this world is nothing but the wares of delusion. (185) You \\nwill surely be tested in your possessions and your souls, and you will surely hear much affront from \\nthose who were given the Book before you and from the polytheists; but if you are patient  and \\nGodwary, that is indeed the steadiest of courses. (186) When Allah made a covenant with those who \\nwere given the Book: ‘You shall explain it for the people, and you shall not conceal it,’ they cast it behind \\ntheir backs and sold it for a paltry gain. How evil is what they buy!

Be wary of your Lord who created you from a single soul, and created its mate from it, and \\nfrom the two of them scattered numerous men and wome n. Be wary of Allah, in whose Name you \\nadjure one another and [of severing ties with] blood relations. Indeed Allah is watchful over you. (1) \\nGive the orphans their property, and do not replace the good with the bad, and do not eat up their \\nproperty [by mi ngling it] with your own property, for that is indeed a great sin. (2) If you fear that you \\nmay not deal justly with the orphans, then marry [other] women that you like, two, three, or four. But if \\nyou fear that you may not treat them fairly, then [marry o nly] one, or [marry from among] your slave -\\nwomen. That makes it likelier that you will not be unfair. (3) Give women their dowries, handing it over \\nto them; but if they remit anything of it of their own accord, then consume it as [something] lawful and \\nwholesome. (4) Do not give the feeble -minded your property, which Allah has assigned you to manage: \\nprovide for them out of it and clothe them, and speak to them honourable words. (5) Test the orphans \\nwhen they reach the age of marriage. Then if you discern i n them maturity, deliver to them their \\nproperty. And do not consume it lavishly and hastily lest they should grow up. As for him who is well-off, \\nlet him be abstemious, and as for him who is poor, let him eat in an honourable manner. And when you \\ndeliver to them their property, take witnesses over them, and Allah suffices as reckoner. (6) Men have a \\nshare in the heritage left by parents and near relatives, and women have a share in the heritage left by \\nparents and near relatives, whether it be little or muc h, a share ordained [by Allah]. (7) And when the \\ndivision is attended by relatives, the orphans and the needy, provide for them out of it, and speak to \\nthem honourable words. (8) Let those fear [the result of mistreating orphans] who, were they to leave \\nbehind weak offspring, would be concerned on their account. So let them be wary of Allah, and let them \\nspeak upright words. (9) Indeed those who consume the property of orphans wrongfully, only ingest fire \\ninto their bellies, and soon they will enter the Bla ze. (10) Allah enjoins you concerning your children: for \\nthe male shall be the like of the share of two females, and if there be [two or] more than two females, \\nthen for them shall be two-thirds of what he leaves; but if she be alone, then for her shall be  a half; and \\nfor each of his parents a sixth of what he leaves, if he has children; but if he has no children, and his \\nparents are his [sole] heirs, then it shall be a third for his mother; but if he has brothers, then a sixth for \\nhis mother, after [paying off] any bequest he may have made or any debt [he may have incurred]. Your \\nparents and your children—you do not know which of them is likelier to be beneficial for you. This is an \\nordinance from Allah. Indeed Allah is all -knowing, all -wise.

For \\nsuch We have prepared a painful punishment. (18)  O you who have faith! It is not lawful for you to \\ninherit women forcibly, and do not press them to take away part of what you have given them, unless \\nthey commit a gross indecency.

Would you take it by way of calumny and fl agrant sin?! (20) How could you take it back, \\nwhen you have known each other, and they have taken from you a solemn covenant? (21) Do not marry \\nany of the women whom your fathers had married, excluding what is already past. That is indeed an \\nindecency, an outrage and an evil course. (22) Forbidden to you are your mothers, your daughters and \\nyour sisters, your paternal aunts and your maternal aunts, your brother’s daughters and your sister’s \\ndaughters, your [foster-]mothers who have suckled you and your sist ers through fosterage, your wives’ \\nmothers, and your stepdaughters who are under your care [born] of the wives whom you have gone \\ninto—but if you have not gone into them there is no sin upon you —and the wives of your sons who are \\nfrom your own loins, and that you should marry two sisters at one time—excluding what is already past; \\nindeed Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful— (23) and married women, excepting your slave-women. This is \\nAllah’s ordinance for you. As to others than these, it is lawful for you t o seek [temporary union with \\nthem] with your wealth, in wedlock, not in license. For the enjoyment you have had from them thereby, \\ngive them their dowries, by way of settlement, and there is no sin upon you in what you may agree upon \\nafter the settlement. Indeed Allah is all-knowing, all-wise. (24) As for those of you who cannot afford to \\nmarry faithful free women, then [let them marry] from what you own, from among your faithful slave -\\nwomen. Your faith is best known [only] to Allah; you are all [on a] simi lar [footing]. So marry them with \\ntheir masters’ permission, and give them their dowries in an honourable manner—[such of them] as are \\nchaste women, not licentious ones or those who take paramours. But should they commit an indecent \\nact on marrying, there shall be for them [only] half the punishment for free women. This is for those of \\nyou who fear falling into fornication; but it is better that you be continent, and Allah is all -forgiving, all-\\nmerciful.

(26) Allah desires \\nto turn toward you clemently, but those who pursue their [base] appetites desire that you fall into gross \\nwaywardness. (27) Allah desires to lighten your burden, for man was created weak. (28) O you who have \\nfaith! Do not eat up your wealth among yourselves unrightfully, but it should be trade by mutual \\nconsent. And do not kill yourselves. Indeed Allah is most me rciful to you. (29) And whoever does that in \\naggression and injustice, We will soon make him enter the Fire, and that is easy for Allah.

Indeed Allah is all -\\nexcusing, all -forgiving. (43) Have you not regarded those who wer e given a share of the Book, who \\npurchase error and desire that you [too] should lose the way? (44) But Allah knows your enemies better, \\nand Allah suffices as guardian, and Allah suffices as helper. (45) Among the Jews are those who pervert \\nwords from thei r meanings and say, ‘We hear and disobey’ and ‘Hear without listening!’ and ‘Ra’ina,’ \\ntwisting their tongues and reviling the faith. But had they said, ‘We hear and obey’ and ‘Listen’ and \\n‘Unzurna,’ it would have been better for them and more upright.

Whoever ascribes partners to Allah has indeed fabricated \\n[a lie] in great sinfulness. (48) Have you not regarded those who style themselves as pure? Indeed, it is \\nAllah who purifies whomever He wishes, and they will not be wronged [so much as] a single date -\\nthread. (49) Look, how they fabricate lies against Allah! That suffices for a flagrant sin.

Why did You not \\nrespite us for a short time?!’ Say, ‘The enjoyments of this world are trifle and the Hereafter is better for \\nthe Godwary, and you will not be wronged so much as a single date -thread. (77) Wherever you may be \\ndeath will overtake you, even if you were in fortified towers.’ If any good befalls them, they say, ‘This is \\nfrom Allah;’ and when an ill befalls them, they say, ‘This is from you.’ Say, ‘All is from Allah.’ What is the \\nmatter with these people that they would not understand any matter? (78) Whatever good befalls you is \\nfrom Allah; and whatever ill befalls you is from yourself. We sent you as an apostle to mankind, and \\nAllah suffices as witness. (79) Whoever obeys the Apostle certainly obeys Allah; and as for th ose who \\nturn their backs [on you]; We have not sent you to keep watch over them. (80) They profess obedience \\n[to you], but when they go out from your presence, a group of them conspire overnight [to do] \\nsomething other than what you say. But Allah records what they conspire overnight. So disregard them \\nand put your trust in Allah, for Allah suffices as trustee. (81) Do they not contemplate the Quran? Had it \\nbeen from [someone] other than Allah, they would have surely found much discrepancy in it. (82) When \\na report of safety or alarm comes to them, they immediately broadcast it; but had they referred it to the \\nApostle or to those vested with authority among them, those of them who investigate would have \\nascertained it. And were it not for Allah’s grace upon you and His mercy, you would have surely followed \\nSatan, [all] except a few. (83) So fight in the way of Allah: you are responsible only for yourself, but urge \\non the faithful [to fight]. Maybe Allah will curb the might of the faithless, for Allah is great est in might \\nand severest in punishment. (84) Whoever intercedes for a good cause shall receive a share of it, and \\nwhoever intercedes for an evil cause shall share its burden, and Allah is prepotent over all things. (85) \\nWhen you are greeted with a salute,  greet with a better one than it, or return it; indeed Allah takes \\naccount of all things. (86) Allah —there is no god except Him —will surely gather you on the Day of \\nResurrection, in which there is no doubt; and who is more truthful in speech than Allah? (8 7) Why \\nshould you be two groups concerning the hypocrites, while Allah has made them relapse [into unfaith] \\nbecause of their deeds? Do you desire to guide someone Allah has led astray? Whomever Allah leads \\nastray, you will never find any way for him. (88) They are eager that you should disbelieve like they have \\ndisbelieved, so that you all become alike. So do not make friends [with anyone] from among them, until \\nthey migrate in the way of Allah. But if they turn their backs, seize them and kill them wherever you find \\nthem, and do not take from among them friends or helpers, (89) excepting those who join a people \\nbetween whom and you there is a treaty, or such as come to you with hearts reluctant to fight you, or to \\nfight their own people. Had Allah wished, H e would have imposed them upon you, and then they would \\nhave surely fought you. So if they keep out of your way and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then \\nAllah does not allow you any course [of action] against them. (90) You will find others desiring  to be \\nsecure from you, and secure from their own people; yet whenever they are called back to polytheism, \\nthey relapse into it. So if they do not keep out of your way, nor offer you peace, nor keep their hands off \\n[from fighting], then seize them and kill  them wherever you confront them, and it is such against whom \\nWe have given you a clear sanction. (91) A believer may not kill another believer, unless it is by mistake. \\nAnyone who kills a believer by mistake should set free a believing slave, and pay bloo d-money to his \\nfamily, unless they remit it in charity. If he belongs to a people that are hostile to you but is a believer, \\nthen a believing slave is to be set free. And if he belongs to a people with whom you have a treaty, the \\nblood-money is to be paid to his family and a believing slave is to be set free. He who cannot afford [to \\npay the blood -money], must fast two successive months as a penance from Allah, and Allah is all -\\nknowing, all-wise. (92) Should anyone kill a believer intentionally, his requital shall be hell, to remain in it'),\n",

When you issue forth in the way of Allah, try to ascertain: do not say to \\nsomeone who offers you peace, ‘You are not a believer,’ seeking the transitory wares of the life of this \\nworld. Yet with Allah are plenteous gains. You too were such earlier, but Allah did you a favour. \\nTherefore, do ascertain. Allah is indeed well aware of what you do. (9 4) Not equal are those of the \\nfaithful who sit back —excepting those who suffer from some disability —and those who wage jihad in \\nthe way of Allah with their possession and their persons. Allah has graced those who wage jihad with \\ntheir possessions and their persons by a degree over those who sit back; yet to each Allah has promised \\nthe best reward, and Allah has graced those who wage jihad over those who sit back with a great \\nreward: (95) ranks from Him, forgiveness, and mercy, and Allah is all -forgiving, all-merciful. (96) Indeed, \\nthose whom the angels take away while they are wronging themselves, they ask, ‘What state were you \\nin?’ They reply, ‘We were oppressed in the land.’ They say, ‘Was not Allah’s earth vast enough so that \\nyou might migrate in it?’ The  refuge of such shall be hell, and it is an evil destination. (97) Except the \\noppressed among men, women and children, who have neither access to any means nor are guided to \\nany way. (98) Maybe Allah will excuse them, for Allah is all -excusing, all -forgiving. (99) Whoever \\nmigrates in the way of Allah will find many havens and plenitude in the earth. And whoever leaves his \\nhome migrating toward Allah and His Apostle, and is then overtaken by death, his reward shall certainly \\nfall on Allah, and Allah is all -forgiving, all-merciful. (100) When you journey in the land, there is no sin \\nupon you in shortening the prayers, if you fear that the faithless may trouble you; indeed the faithless \\nare your manifest enemies. (101) When you are among them, leading them in p rayers, let a group of \\nthem stand with you, carrying their weapons. And when they have done the prostrations, let them \\nwithdraw to the rear, then let the other group which has not prayed come and pray with you, taking \\ntheir precautions and [bearing] their weapons. The faithless are eager that you should be oblivious of \\nyour weapons and your baggage, so that they could assault you all at once. But there is no sin upon you, \\nif you are troubled by rain or are sick, to set aside your weapons; but take your prec autions. Indeed \\nAllah has prepared for the faithless a humiliating punishment. (102) When you have finished the \\nprayers, remember Allah, standing, sitting, and lying down, and when you feel secure, perform the \\n[complete] prayers, for the prayer is indeed a  timed prescription for the faithful. (103) Do not slacken in \\nthe pursuit of these people. If you are suffering, they are also suffering like you, but you expect from \\nAllah what they do not expect, and Allah is all-knowing, all-wise. (104) Indeed We have sent down to you \\nthe Book with the truth, so that you may judge between the people by what Allah has shown you; do \\nnot be an advocate for the traitors, (105) and plead to Allah for forgiveness; indeed Allah is all -forgiving, \\nall-merciful. (106) And do not p lead for those who betray themselves; indeed Allah does not like \\nsomeone who is treacherous and sinful. (107) They try to hide [their real character] from people, but \\nthey do not try to hide from Allah, though He is with them when they conspire overnight w ith a \\ndiscourse that He does not approve of. And Allah comprehends whatever they do. (108) Aha! There you \\nare, pleading for them in the life of this world! But who will plead for them with Allah on the Day of \\nResurrection, or will be their defender? (109) Whoever commits evil or wrongs himself and then pleads \\nto Allah for forgiveness, will find Allah all -forgiving, all-merciful. (110) Whoever commits a sin, commits \\nit only against himself; and Allah is all -knowing, all-wise. (111) But someone who commits an  iniquity or \\nsin and then accuses an innocent person of it, is indeed guilty of calumny and a flagrant sin. (112) Were \\nit not for Allah’s grace and His mercy on you, a group of them were bent on leading you astray; but they \\ndo not mislead anyone except the mselves, and they cannot do you any harm.

(121) But those \\nwho have faith and do righteous deeds, We will admit them into gardens with streams running in them, \\nto remain in them forever —a true promise of Allah, and who is truer in speech than Allah? (122) It will \\nbe neither after your hopes nor the hopes of the People of the Book: whoever commits evil sha ll be \\nrequited for it, and he will not find for himself any guardian or helper besides Allah. (123) And whoever \\ndoes righteous deeds, whether male or female, should he be faithful —such shall enter paradise and \\nthey will not be wronged [so much as] the spec k on a date -stone. (124) Who has a better religion than \\nhim who submits his will to Allah, being virtuous, and follows the creed of Abraham, a Hanif? And Allah \\ntook Abraham for a dedicated friend. (125) To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whate ver is \\non the earth, and Allah comprehends all things. (126) They seek your ruling concerning women. Say, \\n‘Allah gives you a ruling concerning them and what is announced to you in the Book concerning girl \\norphans—whom you do not give what has been prescrib ed for them, and yet you desire to marry \\nthem—and about the weak among children: that you should maintain the orphans with justice, and \\nwhatever good you do, indeed Allah knows it well. (127) If a woman fears from her husband misconduct \\nor desertion, there  is no sin upon the couple if they reach a reconciliation between themselves; and \\nreconcilement is better. The souls are prone to greed; but if you are virtuous and Godwary, Allah is \\nindeed well aware of what you do. (128) You will not be able to be fair b etween wives, even if you are \\neager to do so. Yet do not turn away from one altogether, leaving her as if in a suspense. But if you are \\nconciliatory and Godwary, Allah is indeed all -forgiving, all-merciful. (129) But if they separate, Allah will \\nsuffice ea ch of them out of His bounty, and Allah is all -bounteous, all -wise. (130) To Allah belongs \\nwhatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. We have certainly enjoined those who were \\ngiven the Book before you, and you, that you should be wary of All ah. But if you are faithless, [you \\nshould know that] to Allah indeed belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and \\nAllah is all-sufficient, all-laudable.

(132) If He wishes, He will take you away, O mankind, and bring \\nothers [in your place]; Allah has the power to do that. (133) Whoever desires the reward of this world, \\n[should know that] with Allah is the reward of this worl d and the Hereafter, and Allah is all -hearing, all-\\nseeing. (134) O you who have faith!

[If so,] indeed all honour belongs to Allah. (139) Certainly He has sent \\ndown to you in the Book that when you hear Allah’s signs being disbelieved and derided, do  not sit with \\nthem until they engage in some other discourse, or else you [too] will be like them. Indeed Allah will \\ngather the hypocrites and the faithless in hell all together (140) —those who lie in wait for you: if there \\nis a victory for you from Allah , they say, ‘Were we not with you?’ But if the faithless get a share *of \\nvictory+, they say, ‘Did we not prevail upon you and defend you against the faithful?’ Allah will judge \\nbetween you on the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will never provide the faithl ess any way [to prevail] \\nover the faithful.

And whomever Allah \\nleads astray, you will never find any way for him. (143) O you who have faith! Do not take the faithless \\nfor friends instead of the faithful.

Those are with the faithful, and soon Allah will give the faithful a great reward. \\n(146) Why should Allah punish you if you give thanks and be faithful? And Allah is appreciative, all -\\nknowing. (147) Allah does not like the disclosure of *anyone’s+ evil * conduct] in speech except by \\nsomeone who has been wronged, and Allah is all -hearing, all -knowing.

(151) But \\nthose who have faith in Allah and His apostles and make no distinction between any of them —them He \\nwill soon give their rewards, and Allah is all -forgiving, all-merciful.

Certainly they asked Moses for [something] greater than \\nthat, for they said, ‘Show us Allah visibly,’ whereat a thunderbolt seized them for their wrongdoing. \\nThen they took up the Calf [for worship], after all the manifest proofs that had come to them. Yet We \\nexcused that, and We gave Moses a manifest authority. (153) And We raised the Mount above them for \\nthe sake of their covenant, and We said to them, ‘Enter the gate prostrating’ and We said to them, ‘Do \\nnot violate the Sabbath,’ and  We took from them a solemn covenant. (154) Then because of their \\nbreaking their covenant, their defiance of Allah’s signs, their killing of the prophets unjustly and for their \\nsaying, ‘Our hearts are uncircumcised’… Indeed, Allah has set a seal on them for their unfaith, so they do \\nnot have faith except a few. (155) And for their faithlessness, and their uttering a monstrous calumny \\nagainst Mary, (156) and for their saying, ‘We killed the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the apostle of \\nAllah’—though they did no t kill him nor did they crucify him, but so it was made to appear to them. \\nIndeed those who differ concerning him are surely in doubt about him: they do not have any knowledge \\nof that beyond following conjectures, and certainly, they did not kill him.

(167) Indeed those who are faithless and do wrong, Allah shall never forgive them, nor shall He \\nguide them to any way, (168) except the way to hell, to remain in it forever, and that is easy for Allah. \\n(169) O mankind! The Apostle has certainly brought you the truth from your Lord. So have faith! That is \\nbetter for you. And if you are faithless, [you should know that] to Allah indeed belongs whatever is in \\nthe heavens and the earth, and Allah is all -knowing, all-wise. (170) O People of the Book! Do not exceed \\nthe bounds in your religion, and do not  attribute anything to Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus \\nson of Mary, was only an apostle of Allah, and His Word that He cast toward Mary and a spirit from Him. \\nSo have faith in Allah and His apostles, and do not say, ‘*God is+ a trinity.’ Relinquish [such a creed]! That \\nis better for you. Allah is but the One God. He is far too immaculate to have any son. To Him belongs \\nwhatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and Allah suffices as trustee. (171) The \\nMessiah would never disdain bei ng a servant of Allah, nor would the angels brought near [to Him]. And \\nwhoever disdains His worship and is arrogant, He will gather them all toward Him. (172) As for those \\nwho have faith and do righteous deeds, He will pay them in full their rewards, and He will enhance them \\nout of His grace. But those who are disdainful and arrogant, He will punish them with a painful \\npunishment, and they will not find besides Allah any guardian or helper. (173) O mankind! Certainly, a \\nproof has come to you from your Lord,  and We have sent down to you a manifest light. (174) As for \\nthose who have faith in Allah, and hold fast to Him, He will admit them to His mercy and grace, and He \\nwill guide them on a straight path to Him. (175) They ask you for a ruling. Say, ‘Allah give s you a ruling \\nconcerning the kalalah: If a man dies and has no children [or parents], but has a sister, for her shall be a \\nhalf of what he leaves, and he shall inherit from her if she has no children. If there be two sisters, then \\nthey shall receive two -thirds of what he leaves. But if there be [several] brothers and sisters, then for \\nthe male shall be the like of the share of two females.

But when you emerge from pilgrim sanctity, you may hunt for \\ngame. Ill feeling for a people should not lead you, because they barred you from [access to] the Sacred \\nMosque, to transgress. Cooperate in piety and Godwariness, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression, \\nand be wary of Allah. Indeed Allah is severe in retribution. (2) Y ou are prohibited carrion, blood, the \\nflesh of swine, and what has been offered to other than Allah, and the animal strangled or beaten to \\ndeath, and that which dies by falling or is gored to death, and that which is mangled by a beast of prey—\\nbarring that which you may purify —and what is sacrificed on stone altars [to idols], and that you should \\ndivide by raffling with arrows. All that is transgression. Today the faithless have despaired of your \\nreligion. So do not fear them, but fear Me. Today I have per fected your religion for you, and I have \\ncompleted My blessing upon you, and I have approved Islam as your religion. But should anyone be \\ncompelled by hunger, without inclining to sin, then Allah is indeed all-forgiving, all-merciful. (3) They ask \\nyou as to what is lawful to them. Say, ‘All the good things are lawful to you.’ As for what you have taught \\nhunting dogs [to catch], teaching them out of what Allah has taught you, eat of what they catch for you \\nand mention Allah’s Name over it, and be wary of All ah. Indeed Allah is swift at reckoning. (4) Today all \\nthe good things have been made lawful to you —the food of those who were given the Book is lawful to \\nyou, and your food is lawful to them —and the chaste ones from among faithful women, and chaste \\nwomen o f those who were given the Book before you, when you have given them their dowries, in \\nwedlock, not in license, nor taking paramours. Should anyone renounce his faith, his work shall fail and \\nhe will be among the losers in the Hereafter. (5) O you who have  faith! When you stand up for prayer, \\nwash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe a part of your heads and your feet, up to \\nthe ankles. If you are junub, purify yourselves. But if you are sick, or on a journey, or any of you has \\ncome from the  toilet, or you have touched women, and you cannot find water, then make tayammum \\nwith clean ground and wipe a part of your faces and your hands with it. Allah does not desire to put you \\nto hardship, but He desires to purify you, and to complete His blessi ng upon you so that you may give \\nthanks. (6) Remember Allah’s blessing upon you and His covenant with which He has bound you when \\nyou said, ‘We hear and obey.’ And be wary of Allah. Indeed Allah knows best what is in the breasts. (7) O \\nyou who have faith! Be maintainers, as witnesses for the sake of Allah, of justice, and ill feeling for a \\npeople should never lead you to be unfair. Be fair; that is nearer to Godwariness, and be wary of Allah. \\nAllah is indeed well aware of what you do. (8) Allah has promised those who have faith and do righteous \\ndeeds forgiveness and a great reward. (9) As for those who are faithless and deny Our signs, they shall \\nbe the inmates of hell. (10) O you who have faith! Remember Allah’s blessing upon you when a people \\nset out to ex tend their hands against you, but He withheld their hands from you, and be wary of Allah, \\nand in Allah let all the faithful put their trust. (11) Certainly Allah took a pledge from the Children of \\nIsrael, and We raised among them twelve chiefs. And Allah s aid, ‘I am with you!

(13) Also from those who say, ‘We are Christians,’ We took their pledge; but \\nthey forgot a part of what they were reminded. So We stirred up enmity and hatred among them until \\nthe Day of Resurrection, and soon Allah will inform them concerning what they had been doing. (14) O \\nPeople of the Book! Certainly Our Apostle has come to you, clarif ying for you much of what you used to \\nhide of the Book, and excusing many [an offense of yours]. Certainly, there has come to you a light from \\nAllah, and a manifest Book. (15) With it Allah guides those who follow [the course of] His pleasure to the \\nways of peace, and brings them out from darkness into light by His will, and guides them to a straight \\npath. (16) They are certainly faithless who say, ‘Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary.’ Say, ‘Who can avail \\nanything against Allah should He wish to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother, and \\neveryone upon the earth?’ To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and whatever is \\nbetween them. He creates whatever He wishes, and Allah has power over all things. (17) The Jews and \\nthe Christians say, ‘We are Allah’s children and His beloved ones.’ Say, ‘Then why does He punish you for \\nyour sins?’ No, you are humans from among His creatures. He forgives whomever He wishes, and \\npunishes whomever He wishes, and to Allah belongs the kingdom of the h eavens and the earth, and \\nwhatever is between them, and toward Him is the return. (18) O People of the Book! Certainly Our \\nApostle has come to you, clarifying [the Divine teachings] for you after a gap in [the appearance of] the \\napostles, lest you should s ay, ‘There did not come to us any bearer of good news nor any warner.’ \\nCertainly, there has come to you a bearer of good news and a warner. And Allah has power over all \\nthings. (19) When Moses said to his people, ‘O my people, remember Allah’s blessing upon you when He \\nappointed prophets among you, and made you kings, and gave you what none of the nations were \\ngiven. (20) O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has ordained for you, and do not turn your \\nbacks, or you will become losers.’ (21) They said , ‘O Moses, there are a tyrannical people in it. We will \\nnot enter it until they leave it. But once they leave it, we will go in.’ (22) Said two men from among \\nthose who were Godfearing and whom Allah had blessed: ‘Go at them by the gate! For once, you hav e \\nentered it, you will be victors. Put your trust in Allah, should you be faithful.’ (23) They said, ‘O Moses, \\nwe will never enter it so long as they remain in it. Go ahead, you and your Lord, and fight! We will be \\nsitting right here.’ (24) He said, ‘My Lo rd! I have no power over [anyone] except myself and my brother, \\nso part us from the transgressing lot.’ (25) He said, ‘It shall be forbidden them for forty years: they shall \\nwander about in the earth. So do not grieve for the transgressing lot.’ (26) Relat e to them truly the \\naccount of Adam’s two sons. When the two of them offered an offering, it was accepted from one of \\nthem and not accepted from the other. *One of them+ said, ‘Surely I will kill you.’ *The other one+ said, \\n‘Allah accepts only from the Godwary. (27) Even if you extend your hand toward me to kill me, I will not \\nextend my hand toward you to kill you. Indeed, I fear Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. (28) I desire that \\nyou earn [the burden of] my sin and your sin, to become one of the inmates of the Fire, and such is the \\nrequital of the wrongdoers.’ (29) So his soul prompted him to kill his brother, and he killed him, and thus \\nbecame one of the losers. (30) Then Allah sent a crow, exploring in the ground, to show him how to bury \\nthe corpse of h is brother. He said, ‘Woe to me! Am I unable to be *even+ like this crow and bury my \\nbrother’s corpse?’ Thus he became regretful. (31) That is why We decreed for the Children of Israel that \\nwhoever kills a soul, without [its being guilty of] manslaughter o r corruption on the earth, is as though \\nhe had killed all mankind, and whoever saves a life is as though he had saved all mankind. Our apostles \\ncertainly brought them manifest signs, yet even after that, many of them commit excesses on the earth.'),\n",

Yet in spite of that, they turn their backs \\n[on Him] and they are not believers. (43) We sent down the Torah containing guidance and light. The \\nprophets, who had submitted, judged by it for the Jews, and so did the rabbis and the scribes, as they \\nwere charged to preserve the Book of Allah and were witnesses to it. So do not fear the people, but fear \\nMe, and do not sell My signs for a paltry gain. Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down —it \\nis they who are the faithless. (44) In it We prescribed for them: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a no se \\nfor a nose, and an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and retaliation for wounds. Yet whoever remits it \\nout of charity, that shall be an atonement for him. Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent \\ndown—it is they who are the wrongdoers.

(46) Let the \\npeople of the Evangel judge by what Allah has sent down in it. Those who do not judge by what Allah \\nhas sent down—it is they who are the transgressors.

Such are in a worse situation and more astray \\nfrom the right way.’ (60) When they come to you, they say, ‘We believe.’ Certainly, they enter with \\ndisbelief and leave with it, and Allah knows best as to what they have been concealing. (61) You see \\nmany of them actively engaged in sin and aggression, and consuming illicit gains. Surely, evil is what they \\nhave been doing. (62) Why do not the rabbis and the scribes forbid them from sinful speech and \\nconsuming illicit gains? Surely, evil is what they have been working. (63) The Jews say, ‘Allah’s hand is \\ntied up.’ Tied up be their hands, and cursed be they for what they say! No, His hands are wide open: He \\nbestows as He wishes. Surely many of them will be increased in rebellion and unfaith by what has been \\nsent to you from your Lord, and We have cast enmity and hatred amongst them until the Day of \\nResurrection.

Both of them would eat food. Look how We clarify the signs for them, and yet, look, how \\nthey go astray!

Do not \\nunduly exceed the bounds in your religion and do not follow the fancies of a people who went astray in \\nthe past, and led many astray, and [them selves+ strayed from the right path.’ (77) The faithless among \\nthe Children of Israel were cursed on the tongue of David and Jesus son of Mary. That, because they \\nwould disobey and they used to commit transgression. (78) They would not forbid one another from the \\nwrongs that they committed. Surely, evil is what they had been doing. (79) You see many of them \\nfraternizing with the faithless. Surely evil is what they have sent ahead for their souls, as Allah is \\ndispleased with them and they shall remain in punishment [forever]. (80) Had they believed in Allah and \\nthe Prophet and what has been sent down to him, they would not have taken them for allies. But most \\nof them are transgressors. (81) Surely You will find the most hostile of all people towards the faith ful to \\nbe the Jews and the polytheists, and surely you will find the nearest of them in affection to the faithful \\nto be those who say ‘We are Christians.’ That is because there are priests and monks among them, and \\nbecause they are not arrogant. (82) When they hear what has been revealed to the Apostle, you see \\ntheir eyes fill with tears because of the truth that they recognize. They say, ‘Our Lord, we believe; so \\nwrite us down among the witnesses. (83) Why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has \\ncome to us, eager as we are that our Lord should admit us among the righteous people?’ (84) So, for \\nwhat they said, Allah requited them with gardens with streams running in them, to remain in them \\n[forever], and that is the reward of the virtuous.

The atonement for it is to feed ten needy persons with the average food you give to \\nyour families, or their clothing, or the freeing of a slave. He who cannot afford [any of these] shall fast \\nfor three days. That is the atonement for your oaths when you vow. But keep your oaths. Thus does \\nAllah clarify His signs for you so that you may give thanks. (89) O you who have faith!

(1) It is He who created you f rom clay, then ordained \\nthe term [of your life] —the specified term is with Him —and yet you are in doubt. (2) He is Allah in the \\nheavens and on the earth: He knows your secret and your overt [matters], and He knows what you earn. \\n(3) There did not come to t hem any sign from among the signs of their Lord, but that they used to \\ndisregard it. (4) They have certainly denied the truth when it came to them, but soon there will come to \\nthem the news of what they have been deriding. (5) Have they not regarded how many a generation We \\nhave destroyed before them whom We had granted power in the land in respects that We did not grant \\nyou, and We sent abundant rains for them from the sky and made streams run for them? Then We \\ndestroyed them for their sins, and brought fo rth another generation after them. (6) Had We sent down \\nto you a Book on paper so they could touch it with their [own] hands, [still] the faithless would have \\nsaid, ‘This is nothing but plain magic.’ (7) They say, ‘Why has not an angel been sent down to him?’ Were \\nWe to send down an angel, the matter would surely be decided, and then they would not be granted \\nany respite. (8) Had We made him an angel, We would have surely made him a man, and We would \\nhave surely confounded them just as they confound [the truth now]. (9) Apostles were certainly derided \\nbefore you. Then those who ridiculed them were besieged by what they used to deride. (10) Say, ‘Travel \\nover the land, and then observe how was the fate of the deniers.’ (11) Say, ‘To whom belongs whatever \\nis in the heavens and the earth?’ Say, ‘To Allah. He has made mercy incumbent upon Himself. He will \\nsurely gather you on the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt. Those who have ruined their \\nsouls will not have faith.’ (12) To Him belongs whatever ab ides in the night and the day, and He is the \\nAll-hearing, the All-knowing. (13) Say, ‘Shall I take for guardian *anyone+ other than Allah, the originator \\nof the heavens and the earth, who feeds and is not fed?’ Say, ‘I have been commanded to be the first o f \\nthose who submit *to Allah+, and *told,+ “Never be one of the polytheists.” ’ (14) Say, ‘Indeed, should I \\ndisobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a tremendous day.’ (15) Whoever is spared of it on that day, \\nHe has certainly been merciful to him, and that is manifest success. (16) Should Allah visit you with some \\ndistress there is no one to remove it except Him; and should He bring you some good, then He has \\npower over all things. (17) And He is the All -dominant over His servants, and He is the All -wise, the All-\\naware. (18) Say, ‘What thing is greatest as witness?’ Say, ‘Allah! *He is+ witness between me and you, \\nand this Quran has been revealed to me that I may warn thereby you and whomever it may reach.’ ‘Do \\nyou indeed bear witness that there are other gods besides Allah?’ Say, ‘I do not bear witness *to any \\nsuch thing+.’ Say, ‘Indeed He is the One God, and I indeed disown what you associate *with Him+.’ (19) \\nThose whom We have given the Book recognize him just as they recognize their sons. Those who hav e \\nruined their souls will not have faith. (20) Who is a greater wrongdoer than him who fabricates a lie \\nagainst Allah, or denies His signs? Indeed the wrongdoers will not be felicitous. (21) On the day when \\nWe gather them all together, We shall say to thos e who ascribed partners *to Allah+ ‘Where are your \\npartners that you used to claim?’ (22) Then their only excuse will be to say, ‘By Allah, our Lord, we were \\nnot polytheists.’ (23) Look, how they forswear themselves, and what they used to fabricate has forsaken \\nthem! (24) There are some of them who prick up their ears at you, but We have cast veils on their hearts \\nlest they should understand it, and a deafness into their ears; and though they should see every sign, \\nthey will not believe in it. When they com e to you, to dispute with you, the faithless say, ‘These are \\nnothing but myths of the ancients.’ (25) They dissuade *others+ from *following+ him, and *themselves+\"),\n",

(26) Were you to see \\nwhen they are brought to a halt by the Fire, whereupon they will say, ‘If only we were sent back *into \\nthe world+! Then we will not deny the signs of our Lord, and we will be among the faithful!’ (27) Indeed, \\nwhat they used to hide before has now be come evident to them. But were they to be sent back they \\nwould revert to what they were forbidden, and they are indeed liars. (28) They say, ‘There is nothing but \\nour life of this world, and we shall not be resurrected.’ (29) Were you to see when they are brought to a \\nhalt before their Lord. He will say, ‘Is this not a fact?’ They will say, ‘Yes, by our Lord!’ He will say, ‘So \\ntaste the punishment because of what you used to deny.’ (30) They are certainly losers who deny the \\nencounter with Allah. When the H our overtakes them suddenly, they will say, ‘Alas for us, for what we \\nneglected in it!’ And they will bear their burdens on their backs. Look! Evil is what they bear! (31) The \\nlife of the world is nothing but play and diversion, and the abode of the Hereaf ter is surely better for \\nthose who are Godwary. Do you not exercise your reason? (32) We certainly know that what they say \\ngrieves you. Yet it is not you that they deny, but it is Allah’s signs that the wrongdoers impugn. (33) \\nApostles were certainly denie d before you, yet they patiently bore being denied and tormented until \\nOur help came to them. Nothing can change the words of Allah, and there have certainly come to you \\nsome of the accounts of the apostles. (34) And should their aversion be hard on you, f ind, if you can, a \\ntunnel into the ground, or a ladder into sky, that you may bring them a sign. Had Allah wished, He would \\nhave brought them together on guidance. So do not be one of the ignorant. (35) Only those who listen \\nwill respond [to you]. As for t he dead, Allah will resurrect them, then they will be brought back to Him. \\n(36) They say, ‘Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘Allah is indeed able to \\nsend down a sign,’ but most of them do not know. (37) There is no animal on la nd, nor a bird that flies \\nwith its wings, but they are communities like yourselves. We have not omitted anything from the Book. \\nThen they will be mustered toward their Lord. (38) Those who deny Our signs are deaf and dumb, in a \\nmanifold darkness. Allah leads astray whomever He wishes, and whomever He wishes He puts him on a \\nstraight path. (39) Say, ‘Tell me, should Allah’s punishment overtake you, or should the Hour overtake \\nyou, will you supplicate anyone other than Allah, should you be truthful? (40) No, Him you will \\nsupplicate, and He will remove that for which you supplicated Him, if He wishes, and you will forget \\nwhat you ascribe *to Him+ as *His+ partners.’ (41) We have certainly sent *apostles+ to nations before \\nyou, then We seized them with stress and distress so that they might entreat [Us]. (42) Why did they not \\nentreat when Our punishment overtook them! But their hearts had hardened, and Satan had made \\nwhat they had been doing seem decorous to them. (43) So when they forgot what they had been \\nadmonished of, We opened for them the gates of all [good] things. When they became proud of what \\nthey were given, We seized them suddenly, whereat, behold, they were despondent. (44) Thus the \\nwrongdoing lot were rooted out, and all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. (45) Say, ‘Tell \\nme, should Allah take away your hearing and your sight and set a seal on your hearts, which god other \\nthan Allah can bring it *back+ to you?’ Look, how We paraphrase the signs variously; nevertheless they \\nturn away. (46) Say, ‘Tell me, should Allah’s punishment overtake you suddenly or visibly, will anyone be \\ndestroyed except the wrongdoing lot?’ (47) We do not send the apostles except as bearers of good news \\nand warners. As for those who are faithful and righteous, t hey will have no fear, nor will they grieve. \\n(48) But as for those who deny Our signs, the punishment shall befall them because of the \\ntransgressions they used to commit. (49) Say, ‘I do not say to you that I possess the treasuries of Allah, \\nnor do I know the Unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I follow only what is revealed to me.’ \\nSay, ‘Are the blind one and the seer equal?

(52) Thus do We test them by means of one another so that they should say, ‘Are these the \\nones whom Allah has favoured from among us?!’ Does not Allah know best the grateful? ! (53) When \\nthose who have faith in Our signs come to you, say, ‘Peace to you! Your Lord has made mercy \\nincumbent upon Himself: whoever of you commits an evil [deed] out of ignorance and then repents \\nafter that and reforms, then He is indeed all-forgiving, all-merciful.’ (54) Thus do We elaborate the signs, \\nso that the way of the guilty may be exposed. (55) Say, ‘I have been forbidden to worship those whom \\nyou invoke besides Allah.’ Say, ‘I do not follow your desires, for then I will have gone astray, and I  will \\nnot be among the *rightly+ guided.’ (56) Say, ‘Indeed I stand on a manifest proof from my Lord and you \\nhave denied it. What you seek to hasten is not up to me. Judgement belongs only to Allah; He expounds \\nthe truth and He is the best of judges.’ (57)  Say, ‘If what you seek to hasten were with me, the matter \\nwould surely have been decided between you and me, and Allah knows best the wrongdoers.’ (58) With \\nHim are the treasures of the Unseen; no one knows them except Him. He knows whatever there is in \\nland and sea. No leaf falls without His knowing it, nor is there a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor \\nanything fresh or withered but it is in a manifest Book. (59) It is He who takes your souls by night, and \\nHe knows what you do by day, then He reanima tes you therein so that a specified term may be \\ncompleted. Then to Him will be your return, whereat He will inform you concerning what you used to \\ndo. (60) He is the All -dominant over His servants, and He sends guards to [protect] you. When death \\napproaches anyone of you, Our messengers take him away and they do not neglect [their duty]. (61) \\nThen they are returned to Allah, their real master. Look! All judgement belongs to Him, and He is the \\nswiftest of reckoners. (62) Say, ‘Who delivers you from the darkn ess of land and sea, [when] You invoke \\nHim suppliantly and secretly: ‘‘If He delivers us from this, we will surely be among the grateful’’?’ (63) \\nSay, ‘It is Allah who delivers you from them and from every agony, *but+ then you ascribe partners *to \\nHim+.’ (64) Say, ‘He is able to send upon you a punishment from above you or from under your feet, or \\nconfound you as *hostile+ factions, and make you taste one another’s violence.’ Look, how We \\nparaphrase the signs variously so that they may understand! (65) You r people have denied it, though it \\nis the truth. Say, ‘It is not my business to watch over you.’ (66) For every prophecy there is a \\n[preordained] setting, and soon you will know. (67) When you see those who gossip impiously about Our \\nsigns, avoid them unti l they engage in some other discourse; but if Satan makes you forget, then, after \\nremembering, do not sit with the wrongdoing lot. (68) Those who are Godwary are in no way \\naccountable for them, but this is merely for admonition’s sake, so that they may bew are. (69) Leave \\nalone those who take their religion for play and diversion and whom the life of this world has deceived, \\nand admonish with it, lest any soul should perish because of what it has earned: It shall not have any \\nguardian besides Allah, nor any intercessor; and though it should offer every kind of ransom, it shall not \\nbe accepted from it. They are the ones who perish because of what they have earned; they shall have \\nboiling water for drink and a painful punishment because of what they used to def y. (70) Say, ‘Shall we \\ninvoke besides Allah that which can neither benefit us nor harm us, and turn back on our heels after \\nAllah has guided us, like someone seduced by the devils and bewildered on the earth, who has \\ncompanions that invite him to guidance, *saying,+ ‘‘Come to us!’’?’ Say, ‘Indeed it is the guidance of Allah \\nwhich is [true] guidance. And we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds, (71) and \\nthat ‘‘Maintain the prayer and be wary of Him, and it is He toward whom you will be  gathered.’’ ’ (72) It \\nis He who created the heavens and the earth with reason, and the day He says *to something+, ‘Be!’ it is.'),\n",

(73) When Abraham said to \\nAzar, his father, ‘Do you take idols for gods? Indeed I see you and your people in manifest error.’ (74) \\nThus did We show Abraham the dominions of the heavens and the earth, that he might be of those who \\npossess certitude. (75) When night darkened over him, he saw a star and said, ‘This is my Lord!’ But \\nwhen it set, he said, ‘I do not like those who set.’ (76) Then, when he saw the moon rising, he said, ‘This \\nis my Lord!’ But when it set, he said, ‘Had my Lord not guided me, I would surely have been among the \\nastray lot.’ (77) Then, when he saw the sun rising, he said, ‘This is my Lord! This is bigger!’ But when it \\nset, he said, ‘O my people, indeed I disown what you take as *His+ part ners.’ (78) ‘Indeed I have turned \\nmy face toward Him who originated the heavens and the earth, as a Hanif, and I am not one of the \\npolytheists.’ (79) His people argued with him. He said, ‘Do you argue with me concerning Allah, while He \\nhas guided me for ce rtain? I do not fear what you ascribe to Him as [His] partners, excepting anything \\nthat my Lord may wish. My Lord embraces all things in [His] knowledge. Will you not then take \\nadmonition? (80) How could I fear what you ascribe [to Him] as [His] partners, when you do not fear \\nascribing to Allah partners for which He has not sent down any authority to you? So [tell me,] which of \\nthe two sides has a greater right to safety, if you know? (81) Those who have faith and do not taint their \\nfaith with wrongdoing —for such there shall be safety, and they are the *rightly+ guided.’ (82) This was \\nOur argument that We gave to Abraham against his people. We raise in rank whomever We wish. \\nIndeed your Lord is all -wise, all -knowing. (83) And We gave him Isaac and Jacob and guided each of \\nthem. And Noah We had guided before, and from his offspring, David and Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses \\nand Aaron—thus do We reward the virtuous — (84) and Zechariah, John, Jesus and Ilyas —each of them \\namong the righteous— (85) and Ishmael, Elisha , Jonah and Lot —each We graced over all the nations — \\n(86) and from among their fathers, their descendants and brethren —We chose them and guided them \\nto a straight path. (87) That is Allah’s guidance: with it, He guides whomever He wishes of His servants. \\nBut were they to ascribe any partners [to Allah], what they used to do would not avail them. (88) They \\nare the ones whom We gave the Book, judgement and prophethood. So if these disbelieve in them, We \\nhave certainly entrusted them to a people who will never  disbelieve in them. (89) They are the ones \\nwhom Allah has guided. So follow their guidance. Say, ‘I do not ask you any recompense for it. It is just \\nan admonition for all the nations.’ (90) They did not regard Allah with the regard due to Him when they \\nsaid, ‘Allah has not sent down anything to any human.’ Say, ‘Who had sent down the Book that was \\nbrought by Moses as a light and guidance for the people, which you make into parchments that you \\ndisplay, while you conceal much of it, and [by means of which] y ou were taught what you did not know, \\n*neither+ you nor your fathers?’ Say, ‘Allah!’ Then leave them to play around in their impious gossip.

Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and \\nthey are watchful of their prayers. (92) Who is a greater wrongdoer than him who fabricates a lie against \\nAllah, or says, ‘It has been revealed to me,’ while no thing was revealed to him, and he who says, ‘I will \\nbring the like of what Allah has sent down?’ Were you to see when the wrongdoers are in the throes of \\ndeath, and the angels extend their hands *saying+: ‘Give up your souls! Today you shall be requited wi th \\na humiliating punishment because of what you used to attribute to Allah untruly, and for your being \\ndisdainful towards His signs.’ (93) ‘Certainly you have come to Us alone, just as We created you the first \\ntime, and left behind whatever We had bestowed  on you.

(96) It is \\nHe who made the stars for you, so that you may be guided by them in the darkness of land and sea. We \\nhave certainly elaborated the signs for a people who have knowledge. (97) It is He who created you from \\na single soul, then there is the [enduring] abode and the place of temporary lodging. We have certainly \\nelaborated the signs for a people who understand. (98) It is He who sends down water from the sky, and \\nbrings forth with it every kind of grow ing thing. Then from it We bring forth vegetation from which We \\nproduce the grain, in clusters, and from the palm -tree, from the spathes of it, low -hanging clusters [of \\ndates], and gardens of grapes, olives and pomegranates, similar and dissimilar. Look at  its fruit as it \\nfructifies and ripens. Indeed, there are signs in that for a people who have faith. (99) They make the jinn \\npartners of Allah, though He has created them, and carve out sons and daughters for Him, without any \\nknowledge. Immaculate is He and exalted above what they allege [concerning Him]! (100) The originator \\nof the heavens and the earth —how could He have a child when He has had no spouse? He created all \\nthings and He has knowledge of all things. (101) That is Allah, your Lord, there is no god except Him, the \\ncreator of all things; so worship Him. He watches over all things. (102) The sights do not apprehend Him, \\nyet He apprehends the sights, and He is the All -attentive, the All -aware. (103) *Say,+ ‘Certainly insights \\nhave come to you from y our Lord. So whoever sees, it is to the benefit of his own soul, and whoever \\nremains blind, it is to its detriment, and I am not a keeper over you.’ (104) Thus do We paraphrase the \\nsigns variously, lest they should say, ‘You have received instruction,’ and  so that We may make it clear \\nfor a people who have knowledge. (105) Follow that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, \\nthere is no god except Him, and turn away from the polytheists. (106) Had Allah wished they would not \\nhave ascribed partners [to  Him]. We have not made you a caretaker for them, nor is it your duty to \\nwatch over them. (107) Do not abuse those whom they invoke besides Allah, lest they should abuse \\nAllah out of hostility, without any knowledge. That is how to every people We have mad e their conduct \\nseem decorous. Then their return will be to their Lord and He will inform them concerning what they \\nused to do. (108) They swear by Allah with solemn oaths that were a sign to come to them they would \\nsurely believe in it. Say, ‘These signs are only from Allah,’ and what will bring home to you that they will \\nnot believe even if they came? (109) We transform their hearts and their visions as they did not believe \\nin it the first time, and We leave them bewildered in their rebellion. (110) Even if We had sent down \\nangels to them, and the dead had spoken to them, and We had gathered before them all things \\nmanifestly, they would [still] not believe unless Allah wished. But most of them are ignorant. (111) That \\nis how for every prophet We appointed as enemy the devils from among humans and jinn, who inspire \\neach other with flashy words, deceptively. Had your Lord wished, they would not have done it. So leave \\nthem with what they fabricate, (112) so that toward it may incline the hearts of those who do  not \\nbelieve in the Hereafter, and so that they may be pleased with it and commit what they commit. (113) \\n*Say,+ ‘Shall I seek a judge other than Allah, while it is He who has sent down to you the Book, well -\\nelaborated?’ Those whom We have given the Book k now that it has been sent down from your Lord \\nwith the truth; so do not be one of the skeptics. (114) The word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth \\nand justice. Nothing can change His words, and He is the All -hearing, the All-knowing. (115) If you obey  \\nmost of those on the earth, they will lead you astray from the way of Allah. They follow nothing but \\nconjectures and they do nothing but surmise.

Soon the guilty will be visited by a degradation and severe punishment from \\nAllah because of the plots they used to devise. (124) Whomever Allah des ires to guide, He opens his \\nbreast to Islam, and whomever He desires to lead astray, He makes his breast narrow and straitened as \\nif he were climbing to a height. Thus does Allah lay [spiritual] defilement on those who do not have \\nfaith. (125) This is the straight path of your Lord. We have already elaborated the signs for a people who \\ntake admonition. (126) For them shall be the abode of peace near their Lord and He will be their \\nguardian because of what they used to do. (127) On the day He will gather the m all together, [He will \\nsay+, ‘O company of jinn! You claimed many of the humans.’ Their friends from among the humans will \\nsay, ‘Our Lord, we used each other, and we completed our term which You had appointed for us.’ He \\nwill say, ‘The Fire is your abode, to remain in it *forever+, except what Allah may wish.’ Indeed your Lord \\nis all-wise, all-knowing. (128) That is how We make the wrongdoers one another’s friends because of \\nwhat they used to earn. (129) ‘O company of jinn and humans! Did there not come t o you apostles from \\nyourselves, recounting to you My signs and warning you of the encounter of this Day?’ They will say, \\n‘We testify against ourselves.’ The life of this world had deceived them, and they will testify against \\nthemselves that they had been faithless. (130) This is because your Lord would never destroy the towns \\nunjustly while their people were unaware. (131) For everyone there are ranks in accordance with what \\nthey have done; and your Lord is not oblivious of what they do. (132) Your Lord is the All -sufficient \\ndispenser of mercy. If He wishes, He will take you away, and make whomever He wishes succeed you, \\njust as He produced you from the descendants of another people. (133) Indeed what you are promised \\nwill surely come, and you will not be ab le to thwart it. (134) Say, ‘O my people, act according to your \\nability; I too am acting.

Evil is the \\njudgement that they make. (136) That is how to most of the polytheists the slaying of their children is \\npresented as decorous by those whom they ascribe as partners [to Allah], that they may ruin them and \\nconfound their religion for them. Had Allah wished, they would not have  done it. So leave them with \\nwhat they fabricate.

Soon He will requite them for \\nwhat they used to fabricate. (138) And they say, ‘That which is in the bellies of these cattle is exclusively \\nfor our males and forbidden to our wives.

Say, ‘Is it the two males \\nthat He has forbidden or the two females, or what is contained in the wombs of the two females? \\nInform me with knowledge, should you be truthful. ’ (143) And two of camels and two of oxen.

(144) Say, ‘I do not find in what has been revealed to me that anyone be \\nforbidden to eat anything except carrion or spilt bl ood, or the flesh of swine —for that is indeed \\nunclean—or an impiety offered to other than Allah.’ But should someone be compelled, without being \\nrebellious or aggressive, indeed your Lord is all -forgiving, all -merciful.

Say, ‘Do you have any *revealed+ knowledge that you can produce before \\nus? You follow nothing but conjectures, and you do nothing but s urmise.’ (148) Say, ‘To Allah belongs \\nthe conclusive argument.

(150) Say, ‘Come, I will recount what your Lord has forbidden you. \\nThat you shall not ascribe any partners to Him, and you shal l be good to the parents, you shall not kill \\nyour children due to penury —We will provide for you and for them —you shall not approach \\nindecencies, the outward among them and the inward ones, and you shall not kill a soul [whose life] \\nAllah has made inviolab le, except with due cause.

So \\nwhen they tasted of the tree, their nakedness became exposed to them, and they began to stitch over \\nthemselves with the leaves of paradise. Their Lord called out to them, ‘Did I not forbid you from that \\ntree, and tell you, ‘‘Satan is indeed your manifest enemy?’’ ’ (22) They said, ‘Our Lord, we have wronged \\nourselves!

(100) These are the towns some of whose accounts We recount to \\nyou. Their apostles certainly brought them manifest proofs, but they were not the ones to believe in \\nwhat they had denied earlier. Thus does Allah put a seal on the hearts of the faithless. (101) We did not \\nfind in most of them any [loyalty to] covenants. Indeed, We found most of them to be transgressors. \\n(102) Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Phar aoh and his elite, but they wronged them. \\nSo observe how was the fate of the agents of corruption! (103) And Moses said, ‘O Pharaoh, I am indeed \\nan apostle from the Lord of all the worlds. (104) It behooves me to say nothing about Allah except the \\ntruth. I certainly bring you a manifest proof from your Lord. So let the Children of Israel go with me.’ \\n(105) He said, ‘If you have brought a sign, produce it, should you be truthful.’ (106) Thereat he threw \\ndown his staff, and behold, it became a manifest python . (107) Then he drew out his hand, and behold, \\nit was white to the onlookers. (108) The elite of Pharaoh’s people said, ‘This is indeed an expert \\nmagician; (109) he seeks to expel you from your land.’ ‘So what do you advise?’ (110) They said, ‘Put him \\nand his brother off for a while, and send heralds to the cities, (111) to bring you every expert magician.’ \\n(112) And the magicians came to Pharaoh. They said, ‘We shall indeed have a reward if we were to be \\nthe victors?’ (113) He said, ‘Of course! And indeed you shall be among those near *to me+.’ (114) They \\nsaid, ‘O Moses, will you throw *first+, or shall we throw?’ (115) He said, ‘Throw *yours+.’ So when they \\nthrew, they bewitched the people’s eyes and overawed them, producing a tremendous magic. (116) And \\nWe signalled to Moses: ‘Throw down your staff.’ And behold, it was swallowing what they had faked. \\n(117) So the truth came out, and what they had wrought was reduced to naught. (118) Thereat they \\nwere vanquished, and they retreated, humiliated. (119) And th e magicians fell down in prostration. \\n(120) They said, ‘We have believed in the Lord of all the worlds, (121) the Lord of Moses and Aaron.’ \\n(122) Pharaoh said, ‘Do you profess faith in Him before I may permit you? It is indeed a plot you have \\ndevised in the city to expel its people from it. Soon you will know [the consequences]! (123) Surely I will \\ncut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and then I will surely crucify all of you.’ (124) They said, \\n‘Indeed we shall return to our Lord. (125) You are vindictive toward us only because we have believed in \\nthe signs of our Lord, when they came to us.’ ‘Our Lord! Pour patience upon us, and grant us to die as \\nMuslims.’ (126) The elite of Pharaoh’s people said, ‘Will you leave Moses and his people to cause \\ncorruption in the land, and to abandon you and your gods?’ He said, ‘We will kill their sons and spare \\ntheir women, and indeed we are dominant over them.’ (127) Moses said to his people, ‘Turn to Allah for \\nhelp and be patient. The earth indeed belongs to Alla h, and He gives its inheritance to whomever He \\nwishes of His servants, and the outcome will be in favour of the Godwary.’ (128) They said, ‘We were \\ntormented before you came to us and *also+ after you came to us.’ He said, ‘Maybe your Lord will \\ndestroy you r enemy and make you successors in the land, and then He will see how you act.’ (129) \\nCertainly We afflicted Pharaoh’s clan with droughts and loss of produce, so that they may take \\nadmonition. (130) But whenever any good came to them, they would say, ‘This  is our due.’ And if any ill \\nvisited them, they took it for ill omens attending Moses and those who were with him. (Look! Indeed the \\ncause of their ill omens is from Allah, but most of them do not know.) (131) And they said, ‘Whatever \\nsign you may bring us  to bewitch us, we are not going to believe you.’ (132) So We sent against them a \\nflood and locusts, lice, frogs and blood, as distinct signs. But they acted arrogantly, and they were a \\nguilty lot. (133) Whenever a plague fell upon them, they would say, ‘O Moses, invoke your Lord for us by \\nthe covenant He has made with you.

(136) We made the people who were abased the heirs to the east and west of the land which We \\nhad blessed, and your Lord’s best word *of promise+ was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of \\ntheir patience, and We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people had built and what they used to erect. \\n(137) We carried the Children of I srael across the sea, whereat they came upon a people cleaving to \\ncertain idols that they had.

But look \\nat the mountain: if it abides in its place, then you will see Me.’ So when his Lord disclosed Himself to the \\nmountain, He levelled it, and Moses fell down swooning. When he recovered, he said,  ‘Immaculate are \\nYou! I turn to You in penitence, and I am the first of the faithful.’ (143) He said, ‘O Moses, I have chosen \\nyou over the people with My messages and My speech. So take what I give you, and be among the \\ngrateful.’ (144) We wrote for him in  the tablets advice concerning all things and an elaboration of all \\nthings, *and We said+, ‘Hold on to them with power, and bid your people to hold on to the best of *what \\nis in] them. Soon I shall show you the abode of the transgressors. (145) Soon I shal l turn away from My \\nsigns those who are unduly arrogant in the earth: [even] though they should see every sign, they will not \\nbelieve in it, and if they see the way of rectitude they will not take it as [their] way, and if they see the \\nway of error they wi ll take it as [their] way. That is because they deny Our signs and are oblivious to \\nthem.’ (146) Those who deny Our signs and the encounter of the Hereafter, their works have failed. \\nShall they not be requited for what they used to do? (147) The people of Moses took up in his absence a \\ncalf [cast] from their ornaments —a body that gave out a lowing sound. Did they not regard that it did \\nnot speak to them, nor did it guide them to any way? They took it up [for worship] and they were \\nwrongdoers. (148) But when  they became remorseful and realised they had gone astray, they said, \\n‘Should our Lord have no mercy on us, and forgive us, we will be surely among the losers.’ (149) When \\nMoses returned to his people, angry and indignant, he said, ‘Evil has been your cond uct in my absence! \\nWould you hasten on the edict of your Lord?’ He threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the \\nhead, pulling him towards himself. He said, ‘Son of my mother, indeed this people thought me to be \\nweak, and they were about to kill me. So do not let the enemies gloat over me, and do not take me with \\nthe wrongdoing lot.’ (150) He said, ‘My Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us into Your mercy, \\nfor You are the most merciful of the merciful.

(158) Among the \\npeople of Moses is a nation who gu ide [the people] by the truth and do justice thereby. (159) We split \\nthem up into twelve tribal communities, and We revealed to Moses, when his people asked him for \\nwater, *saying+, ‘Strike the rock with your staff,’ whereat twelve fountains gushed forth f rom it. Every \\ntribe came to know its drinking -place. And We shaded them with clouds, and We sent down to them \\nmanna and quails: ‘Eat of the good things We have provided you.’ And they did not wrong Us, but they \\nused to wrong [only] themselves. (160) And wh en they were told, ‘Settle in this town and eat thereof \\nwhence you wish; and say, ‘‘Relieve *us of the burden of our sins+,’’ and enter prostrating at the gate, \\nthat We may forgive your iniquities, and soon We shall enhance the virtuous.’ (161) But the wro ngdoers \\nchanged the saying with other than what they had been told. So We sent against them a plague from \\nthe sky because of the wrongs they used to commit. (162) Ask them about the town that was situated \\non the seaside, when they violated the Sabbath, whe n their fish would come to them on the Sabbath \\nday, visibly on the shore, but on days when they were not keeping Sabbath they would not come to \\nthem. Thus did We test them because of the transgressions they used to commit. (163) When a group of \\nthem said, ‘Why do you advise a people whom Allah will destroy, or punish with a severe punishment?’ \\nThey said, ‘As an excuse before your Lord, and *with the hope+ that they may be Godwary.’ (164) So \\nwhen they forgot what they had been reminded of, We delivered those  who forbade evil [conduct] and \\nseized the wrongdoers with a terrible punishment because of the transgressions they used to commit. \\n(165) When they defied [the command pertaining to] what they were forbidden from, We said to them, \\n‘Be you spurned apes.’ (1 66) And when your Lord proclaimed that He would surely send against them, \\nuntil the Day of Resurrection, those who would inflict on them a terrible punishment. Indeed your Lord \\nis swift in retribution, and indeed, He is all -forgiving, all -merciful. (167) W e dispersed them into \\ncommunities around the earth: some of them were righteous, and some of them otherwise, and We \\ntested them with good and bad [times] so that they may come back. (168) Then they were succeeded by \\nan evil posterity, which inherited the Book: they grab the transitory gains of this lower world, and say, ‘It \\nwill be forgiven us.’ And if similar transitory gains were to come their way, they would grab them too. \\nWas not the covenant of the Book taken with them that they shall not attribute anything to Allah except \\nthe truth? They have studied what is in it, and [know that] the abode of the Hereafter is better for those \\nwho are Godwary. Do you not exercise your reason?

(183) Have they \\nnot reflected that there is no madness in their companion, [and that] he is just a manifest warner? (184) \\nHave they not contemplated the dominions of the heavens and the earth, and whatever things Allah has \\ncreated, and that maybe thei r time has already drawn near? So what discourse will they believe after \\nthis?! (185) Whomever Allah leads astray has no guide, and He leaves them bewildered in their \\nrebellion. (186) They question you concerning the Hour, when will it set in? Say, ‘Its kn owledge is only \\nwith my Lord: none except Him shall manifest it at its time. It will weigh heavy on the heavens and the \\nearth. It will not overtake you but suddenly.’ They ask you as if you were in the know of it. Say, ‘Its \\nknowledge is only with Allah, bu t most people do not know.’ (187) Say, ‘I have no control over any \\nbenefit for myself, nor [over] any harm except what Allah may wish. Had I known the Unseen, I would \\nhave acquired much good, and no ill would have befallen me. I am only a warner and bearer  of good \\nnews to a people who have faith.’ (188) It is He who created you from a single soul, and made from it its \\nmate, that he might find comfort with her. So when he had covered her, she bore a light burden and \\npassed [some time] with it. When she had g rown heavy, they both invoked Allah, their Lord: ‘If You give \\nus a healthy *child+, we will be surely grateful.’ (189) Then when He gave them a healthy *child+, they \\nascribed partners to Him in what He had given them.

So taste the punishment because of what you used to defy. (35) Indeed the \\nfaithless spend their wealth to bar from the way of Allah. Soon they will have spent it, then it will be a \\ncause of regret to them, then they will be overcome, and the faithless will be gathered toward Hell, (36) \\nso that Allah may separate the bad ones from t he good, and place the bad on one another, and pile \\nthem up together, and cast them into hell. It is they who are the losers. (37) Say to the faithless, if they \\ncease [their belligerence against the Muslims], what is already past shall be forgiven them. Bu t if they \\nresume [their hostilities], then the precedent of the predecessors has already come to pass. (38) Fight \\nthem until persecution is no more, and religion becomes exclusively for Allah. So if they desist, Allah \\nindeed watches what they do. (39) But if they turn away, then know that Allah is your master: an \\nexcellent master and an excellent helper! (40) Know that whatever thing you may come by, a fifth of it is \\nfor Allah and the Apostle, for the relatives and the orphans, for the needy and the travell er, if you have \\nfaith in Allah and what We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Separation, the day when the two \\nhosts met; and Allah has power over all things. (41) When you were on the nearer side, and they on the \\nfarther side, while the caravan was be low you, and had you agreed together on an encounter, you \\nwould have certainly failed to keep the tryst, but in order that Allah may carry through a matter that was \\nbound to be fulfilled, so that he who perishes might perish by a manifest proof, and he who  lives may \\nlive on by a manifest proof, and Allah is indeed all -hearing, all-knowing. (42) When Allah showed them \\nto you as few in your dream, and had He shown them as many, you would have lost heart, and disputed \\nabout the matter. But Allah spared you. In deed He knows well what is in the breasts. (43) And when He \\nshowed them to you as few in your eyes, when you met them [on the battlefield], and He made you \\n[appear] few in their eyes, [it was] in order that Allah may carry through a matter that was bound t o be \\nfulfilled, and to Allah all matters are returned. (44) O you who have faith! When you meet a host [in \\nbattle], then stand firm, and remember Allah greatly so that you may be felicitous. (45) And obey Allah \\nand His Apostle, and do not dispute, or you w ill lose heart and your power will be gone. And be patient; \\nindeed Allah is with the patient. (46) Do not be like those who left their homes vainly and to show off to \\nthe people, and to bar [other people] from the way of Allah, and Allah comprehends what t hey do. (47) \\nWhen Satan made their deeds seem decorous to them, and said *to the faithless+, ‘No one shall \\novercome you today from among all mankind, and I will stand by you.’ But when the two hosts sighted \\neach other, he took to his heels, saying, ‘Indeed I am quit of you. I see what you do not see. Indeed I fear \\nAllah, and Allah is severe in retribution.’ (48) When the hypocrites said, and *also+ those in whose hearts \\nis a sickness, ‘Their religion has deceived them.’ But whoever puts his trust in Allah, then Allah is indeed \\nall-mighty, all-wise. (49) Were you to see when the angels take away the faithless, striking their faces \\nand their backs, *saying+, ‘Taste the punishment of the burning. (50) That is because of what your hands'),\n",

That is because they are a people who do not know. (6) How shall the polytheists \\nhave any [valid] treaty with Allah and His Apostle?! (Barring those with whom you made a treaty at the \\nHoly Mosque; so long as they are steadfast with you, be steadfast with them. Indeed Allah loves the \\nGodwary.) (7) How? For if, they get the better of you, they will observ e toward you neither kinship nor \\ncovenant. They please you with their mouths while their hearts spurn you; and most of them are \\ntransgressors. (8) They have sold the signs of Allah for a paltry gain, and have barred [the people] from \\nHis way. Evil indeed i s what they have been doing. (9) They observe toward a believer neither kinship \\nnor covenant, and it is they who are the transgressors. (10) Yet if they repent and maintain the prayer \\nand give the zakat, then they are your brethren in faith. We elaborate t he signs for a people who have \\nknowledge. (11) But if they break their pledges after their having made a treaty and revile your religion, \\nthen fight the leaders of unfaith —indeed, they have no [commitment to] pledges, —maybe they will \\ndesist. (12) Will you not make war on a people who broke their pledges and resolved to expel the \\nApostle, and opened [hostilities] against you initially? Do you fear them? But Allah is worthier of being \\nfeared by you, should you be faithful. (13) Make war on them so that Allah may punish them by your \\nhands and humiliate them, and help you against them, and heal the hearts of a faithful folk, (14) and \\nremove rage from their hearts, and Allah turns clemently to whomever He wishes, and Allah is all -\\nknowing, all-wise (15) Do you sup pose that you will be let off while Allah has not yet ascertained those \\nof you who wage jihad and those who do not take anyone as [their] confidant besides Allah and His \\nApostle and the faithful?

(30) They have taken their \\nscribes and their monks as lords besides Allah, and also Christ, Mary’s son; though they were \\ncommanded to worship only the One God, there is no god except Him; He is far too immaculate to have \\nany partners that they ascribe [to Him]! (31) They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths, \\nbut Allah is intent on perfecting His light though the faithless should be averse. (32) It is He who has sent \\nHis Apostle with  the guidance and the religion of truth that He may make it prevail over all religions, \\nthough the polytheists should be averse. (33) O you who have faith! Indeed many of the scribes and \\nmonks wrongfully eat up the people’s wealth, and bar *them+ from the way of Allah. Those who treasure \\nup gold and silver, and do not spend it in the way of Allah, inform them of a painful punishment (34) on \\nthe day when these shall be heated in hellfire and therewith branded on their foreheads, their sides, \\nand their backs *and told+: ‘This is what you treasured up for yourselves! So taste what you have \\ntreasured!’ (35) Indeed the number of months with Allah is twelve months in Allah’s Book, the day when \\nHe created the heavens and the earth. Of these, four are sacred. That i s the upright religion. So do not \\nwrong yourselves during them. Fight all the polytheists, just as they fight you all, and know that Allah is \\nwith the Godwary.

They allow it in one year and forbid it another year, so as to fit in with the number, which Allah \\nhas made inviolable, thus permitting what Allah has forbidden.

(54) So let not their wealth \\nand children impress you: Allah only desires to punish them with these in the life of this world, and that \\ntheir souls may depart while they are faithless.

(56) If they could find a refuge, or a hideout, \\nor a hole [to creep into], they would turn to it in frantic haste. (57) There are some of them who blame \\nyou regarding [the distribution of] the charities: if they are given from them, they are pleased, but if \\nthey are not given from them, behold, they are displeased. (58) [It would have been better] if they had \\nbeen pleased with what Allah and His Apostle gave them, and had said, ‘Allah is sufficient for us; Allah \\nand His Apostle will give to us out of His grace.

But they certainly did utter the word of \\nunfaith and renounced faith after their Islam. They contemplated what they could not achieve, and they \\nwere vindictive only because Allah and His Apostle had en riched them out of His grace. Yet if they \\nrepent, it will be better for them; but if they turn away, Allah shall punish them with a painful \\npunishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they shall not find on the earth any guardian or helper. \\n(74) Among them are those who made a pledge with Allah: ‘If He gives us out of His grace, we will surely \\ngive the zakat and we will surely be among the righteous.’ (75) But when He gave them out of His grace, \\nthey begrudged it and turned away, being disregardful. (76 ) So He caused hypocrisy to ensue in their \\nhearts until the day they will encounter Him, because of their going back on what they had promised \\nAllah and because of the lies they used to tell. (77) Do they not know that Allah knows their secret \\n[thoughts] and [hears] their secret talks, and that Allah is knower of all that is Unseen?

(89) Some of the \\nBedouins who sought to be excused came, so that they may be granted leave [to stay back]; while those \\nwho lied to Allah and His Apostle sat back.

(91) Nor [is there any blame] on those to whom, when \\nthey came to you to provide them wi th a mount, you said, ‘I do not find any mount for you,’ and they \\nturned back, their eyes flowing with tears, grieved because they did not find any means to spend. (92) \\nThe blame lies only on those who ask leave of you [to stay behind] though they are well -off. They are \\npleased to be with those who stay back; Allah has set a seal on their hearts, so they do not know [the \\noutcome of their conduct+. (93) They will offer you excuses when you return to them. Say, ‘Do not make \\nexcuses; we will never believe you.  Allah has informed us of your state of affairs. Allah and His Apostle \\nwill observe your conduct, then you will be returned to the Knower of the sensible and the Unseen, and \\nHe will inform you concerning what you used to do.’ (94) They will swear to you by  Allah when you \\nreturn to them, that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone. They are indeed filth, and their \\nrefuge shall be hell, a requital for what they used to earn. (95) They swear to you that you may be \\nreconciled to them. But even if you are  reconciled to them, Allah shall not be reconciled to the \\ntransgressing lot. (96) The Bedouins are more obdurate in unfaith and hypocrisy, and more apt to be \\nignorant of the precepts that Allah has sent down to His Apostle, and Allah is all -knowing, all-wise. (97) \\nAmong the Bedouins are those who regard what they spend as a loss, and they watch for a reversal of \\nyour fortunes. Theirs shall be an adverse turn of fortune, and Allah is all -hearing, all-knowing. (98) Yet \\namong the Bedouins are [also] those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and regard what they spend \\nas [a means of attaining] nearness to Allah and the blessings of the Apostle.

(101) [There are] others who have confessed to their sins, having mixed up righteous \\nconduct with other that was evil. Maybe Allah will accept their repentance.

(109) The building they \\nhave built will never cease to be [a source of] di squiet in their hearts until their hearts are cut into \\npieces, and Allah is all -knowing, all-wise. (110) Indeed Allah has bought from the faithful their souls and \\ntheir possessions for paradise to be theirs: they fight in the way of Allah, kill, and are ki lled. A promise \\nbinding upon Him in the Torah and the Evangel and the Quran. And who is truer to his promise than \\nAllah? So rejoice in the bargain you have made with Him, and that is the great success. (111) [The \\nfaithful are] penitent, devout, celebrators  of Allah’s praise, wayfarers, who bow *and+ prostrate *in \\nprayer+, bid what is right and forbid what is wrong, and keep Allah’s bounds—and give good news to the \\nfaithful. (112) The Prophet and the faithful may not plead for the forgiveness of the polythei sts, even if \\nthey should be [their] relatives, after it has become clear to them that they will be the inmates of hell. \\n(113) Abraham’s pleading forgiveness for his father was only to fulfill a promise he had made him. So \\nwhen it became manifest to him that he was an enemy of God, he repudiated him. Indeed Abraham was \\nmost plaintive and forbearing. (114) Allah does not lead any people astray after He has guided them \\nuntil He has made clear to them what they should beware of. Indeed Allah has knowledge of al l things. \\n(115) Indeed to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and brings death. \\nAnd besides Allah you do not have any guardian or helper. (116) Certainly Allah turned clemently to the \\nProphet and the Emigrants and the Help ers, who followed him in the hour of difficulty, after the hearts \\nof a part of them were about to swerve. Then He turned clemently to them —indeed, He is most kind \\nand merciful to them (117) —and to the three who were left behind. When the earth became narr ow \\nfor them with [all] its expanse, and their own souls weighed heavily on them, and they knew that there \\nwas no refuge from Allah except in Him, then He turned clemently toward them so that they might be \\npenitent. Indeed Allah is the All -clement, the All-merciful. (118) O you who have faith! Be wary of Allah, \\nand be with the Truthful. (119) It is not fitting for the people of Madinah and the Bedouins around them \\nto hang back behind the Apostle of Allah and prefer their own lives to his life. That is becaus e they \\nneither experience any thirst, nor fatigue, nor hunger, in the way of Allah, nor do they tread any ground \\nenraging the faithless, nor do they gain any ground against an enemy but a righteous deed is written for \\nthem on its account. Indeed Allah does  not waste the reward of the virtuous. (120) And neither do they \\nincur any expense, big or small, nor do they cross any valley, but it is written to their account, so that \\nAllah may reward them by the best of what they used to do. (121) Yet it is not for the faithful to go forth \\nen masse. But why should not there a group from each of their sections go forth to become learned in \\nreligion, and to warn their people when they return to them, so that they may beware?

These are the signs of the Wise Book. (1) Does it seem odd to these people that We have \\nrevealed to a man from among themselves, *declaring+, ‘Warn mankind, and give good news to the \\nfaithful that they are in good standing with their Lord’? The faithless say, ‘This is indeed a plain \\nmagician.’ (2) Indeed your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and then \\nsettled on the Throne, directing the command. There is no intercessor, except by His leave. That is Allah, \\nyour Lord! So worship Him. Will you not then take admonition? (3) To Him will be the return of you all; \\n*that is+ Allah’s true promise. Indeed, He originates the creation, then He will bring it back that He may \\nreward with justice those who have faith and do r ighteous deeds. As for the faithless, they shall have \\nboiling water for drink, and a painful punishment because of what they used to defy. (4) It is He who \\nmade the sun a radiance and the moon a light, and ordained its phases that you might know the number \\nof years and the calculation [of time]. Allah did not create all that except with justice. He elaborates the \\nsigns for a people who have knowledge. (5) Indeed in the alternation of night and day, and whatever \\nAllah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are surely signs for a people who are Godwary. (6) \\nIndeed those who do not expect to encounter Us and who are pleased with the life of this world and \\nsatisfied with it, and those who are oblivious of Our signs (7) —it is they whose refuge shall be the Fire \\nbecause of what they used to earn. (8) Indeed those who have faith and do righteous deeds, their Lord \\nguides them by the means of their faith. Streams will run for them in gardens of bliss. (9) Their call \\ntherein will be, ‘O Allah! Immaculate are You!’ and their greeting therein will be, ‘Peace!’ and their \\nconcluding call, ‘All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.’ (10) Were Allah to hasten ill for \\nmankind with their haste for good, their term would have been over. But We leave thos e who do not \\nexpect to encounter Us bewildered in their rebellion. (11) When distress befalls man, he supplicates Us, \\n[lying] on his side, sitting, or standing; but when We remove his distress, he passes on as if he had never \\nsupplicated Us concerning the distress that had befallen him. What they have been doing is thus \\npresented as decorous to the transgressors. (12) Certainly We destroyed generations before you when \\nthey perpetrated wrongs: their apostles brought them manifest proofs, but they would not h ave faith. \\nThus do We requite the guilty lot. (13) Then We made you successors on the earth after them that We \\nmay observe how you will act. (14) When Our manifest signs are recited to them, those who do not \\nexpect to encounter Us say, ‘Bring a Quran other  than this, or alter it.’ Say, ‘I may not alter it of my own \\naccord. I follow only what is revealed to me. Indeed should I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a \\ntremendous day.’ (15) Say, ‘Had Allah *so+ wished, I would not have recited it to you, no r would He have \\nmade it known to you, for I have dwelled among you for a lifetime before it. Do you not exercise your \\nreason?’ (16) So who is a greater wrongdoer than him who fabricates a lie against Allah, or denies His \\nsigns? Indeed the guilty will not b e felicitous. (17) They worship besides Allah that which neither causes \\nthem any harm, nor brings them any benefit, and they say, ‘These are our intercessors with Allah.’ Say, \\n‘Will you inform Allah about something He does not know in the heavens or on the  earth?’ Immaculate \\nis He and exalted above [having] any partners that they ascribe [to Him]! (18) Mankind were but a single \\n[religious] community; then they differed. And were it not for a prior decree of your Lord, decision \\nwould have been made between them concerning that about which they differ. (19) They say, ‘Why has \\nnot some sign been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘*The knowledge of+ the Unseen belongs only \\nto Allah. So wait. I too am waiting along with you.’ (20) When We let people taste *Ou r] mercy after a \\ndistress that has befallen them, behold, they scheme against Our signs! Say, ‘Allah is more swift at'),\n",

(21) It is He who carries you across land \\nand sea. When you are in the ships,  and they sail along with them with a favourable wind, exulting in it, \\nthere comes upon them a tempestuous wind and waves assail them from every side, and they think that \\nthey are besieged, they invoke Allah putting exclusive faith in Him, ‘If You deliver us from this, we will \\nsurely be among the grateful.’ (22) But when He delivers them, behold, they commit violations on the \\nearth unduly! O mankind! Your violations are only to your own detriment. [These are] the wares of the \\nlife of this world; then to Us will be your return, whereat We will inform you concerning what you used \\nto do. (23) The parable of the life of this world is that of water which We send down from the sky. It \\nmingles with the earth’s vegetation from which humans and cattle eat. When the earth puts on its luster \\nand is adorned, and its inhabitants think they have power over it, Our edict comes to it, by night or day, \\nwhereat We turn it into a mown field, as if it did not flourish the day before. Thus do We elaborate the \\nsigns for a people w ho reflect. (24) Allah invites to the abode of peace, and He guides whomever He \\nwishes to a straight path. (25) Those who are virtuous shall receive the best reward and an \\nenhancement. Neither dust nor abasement shall overcast their faces. They shall be th e inhabitants of \\nparadise, and they shall remain in it [forever]. (26) For those who have committed misdeeds, the \\nrequital of a misdeed shall be its like, and they shall be overcast by abasement. They shall have no one \\nto protect [them] from Allah. [They will be] as if their faces were covered with dark patches of the night. \\nThey shall be the inmates of the Fire, and they shall remain in it [forever]. (27) On the day when We \\ngather them all together, We shall say to those who ascribe partners *to Allah+, ‘S tay where you are —\\nyou and your partners!’ Then We shall set them apart from one another, and their partners will say, ‘It \\nwas not us that you worshipped. (28) Allah suffices as a witness between you and us. We were indeed \\nunaware of your worship.’ (29) The re every soul will examine what it has sent in advance, and they will \\nbe returned to Allah, their real master, and what they used to fabricate will forsake them. (30) Say, ‘Who \\nprovides for you out of the sky and the earth? Who controls [your] hearing and sight, and who brings \\nforth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living, and who directs the command?’ \\nThey will say, ‘Allah.’ Say, ‘Will you not then be wary *of Him+?’ (31) That, then, is Allah, your true Lord. \\nSo what is there after the truth except error? Then where are you being led away? (32) Thus the word of \\nyour Lord became due against those who transgress, that they shall not have faith. (33) Say, ‘Is there \\nanyone among your partners who originates the creation and then bring s it back?’ Say, ‘Allah originates \\nthe creation, then He will bring it back.’ Then where do you stray? (34) Say, ‘Is there anyone among your \\npartners who may guide to the truth?’ Say, ‘Allah guides to the truth. Is He who guides to the truth \\nworthier to be followed, or he who is not guided unless shown the way? What is the matter with you? \\nHow do you judge?’ (35) Most of them just follow conjecture; indeed conjecture is no substitute for the \\ntruth. Indeed Allah knows best what they do. (36) This Quran could  not have been fabricated by anyone \\nbesides Allah; rather, it is a confirmation of what was [revealed] before it, and an elaboration of the \\nBook, there is no doubt in it, from the Lord of all the worlds. (37) Do they say, ‘He has fabricated it?’ Say, \\n‘Then bring a surah like it, and invoke whomever you can, besides Allah, should you be truthful.’ (38) \\nIndeed, they deny something whose knowledge they do not comprehend, and whose explanation has \\nnot yet come to them. Those who were before them denied likewise . So observe how was the fate of \\nthe wrongdoers! (39) Some of them believe in it, and some of them do not believe in it, and your Lord \\nbest knows the agents of corruption. (40) If they deny you, say, ‘My deeds belong to me and your deeds \\nbelong to you: you are absolved of what I do and I am absolved of what you do.’ (41) There are some of \\nthem who prick up their ears at you. But can you make the deaf hear even if they do not exercise their \\nreason? (42) There are some of them who observe you. But can you gui de the blind even if they do not'),\n",

(46) There is an apostle for every nation; so when their apostle comes, \\njudgement is made between them with justice, and they are not wronged.

Shall you not be requited for what you used to earn?’ (52) They inquire of you, ‘Is it true?’ \\nSay, ‘Yes! By my Lord, it is true, and you cannot frustrate *Him+.’ (53) Were any soul that has done wrong \\nto possess whatever there is on the earth, it would surely offer it for ransom. They will hide their \\nremorse when they sight the punishment; and judgement will be made between them with justice and \\nthey will not be wronged. (54)  Look!

Indeed Allah is gracious to mankind, but most of them do \\nnot give thanks. (60) You do not engage in any work, neither do you recite any part of the Quran, nor do \\nyou perform any d eed without Our being witness over you when you are engaged therein. Not an \\natom’s weight escapes your Lord in the earth or in the sky, nor *is there+ anything smaller than that nor \\nbigger, but it is in a manifest Book. (61) Look! The friends of Allah will  indeed have no fear nor will they \\ngrieve (62) —those who have faith and are Godwary. (63) For them is good news in the life of this world \\nand in the Hereafter. (There is no altering the words of Allah.) That is the great success. (64) Do not \\ngrieve at the ir remarks; indeed all might belongs to Allah; He is the All -hearing, the All -knowing. (65) \\nLook! To Allah indeed belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth. What do they \\npursue who invoke partners besides Allah? They merely follow conjectures and they just make surmises. \\n(66) It is He who made the night for you, that you may rest in it, and the day to provide visibility.

If you have faith in Allah, \\nput your trust in Him, if you have submitted *to Him+.’ (84) Whereat they said, ‘In Allah we have put our \\ntrust.’ ‘Our Lord! Do not make us a *means of+ test for the wrong doing lot, (85) and deliver us by Your \\nmercy from the faithless lot.’ (86) We revealed to Moses and his brother *saying+, ‘Settle your people in \\nthe city, and let your houses face each other, and maintain the prayer, and give good news to the \\nfaithful.’ (87) Moses said, ‘Our Lord! You have given Pharaoh and his elite glamour and wealth in the life \\nof this world, our Lord, that they may lead [people] astray from Your way! Our Lord! Blot out their \\nwealth and harden their hearts so that they do not believe unt il they sight the painful punishment.’ (88) \\nSaid He, ‘Your supplication has already been granted. So be steadfast, and do not follow the way of \\nthose who do not know.’ (89) We carried the Children of Israel across the sea, whereat Pharaoh and his \\ntroops pursued them, out of defiance and aggression. When overtaken by drowning, he called out, ‘I \\nbelieve that there is no god except Him in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am one of those \\nwho submit *to Him+!’ (90) *He was told,+ ‘What! Now? When you have been disobedient heretofore and \\nwere among the agents of corruption?! (91) So today We shall deliver your body so that you may be a \\nsign for those who come after you.’ Indeed many of the people are oblivious to Our signs. (92) Certainly \\nWe settled the Children of Israel in a worthy settlement and We provided them with all the good things, \\nand they did not differ until [after] the knowledge had come to them. Your Lord will indeed judge \\nbetween them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that about which they used to differ. (93) So if you \\nare in doubt about what We have sent down to you, ask those who read the Book [revealed] before you. \\nThe truth has certainly come to you from your Lord; so do not be among the skeptics. (94) And do not be \\nof those who deny the signs of Allah, [for] then you shall be among the losers. (95) Indeed those against \\nwhom your Lord’s judgement has become due will not have faith, (96) even though every sign were to \\ncome to them, until they sight the painful punishment. (97) Why has  there not been any town that \\nmight believe, so that its belief might benefit it, except the people of Jonah?

[This is] a Book, whose signs have been made definitive and then elaborated, from One \\n[who is] all-wise, all-aware, (1) declaring: ‘Worship no one but Allah. I am indeed a warner to you from \\nHim and a bearer of good news. (2) Plead with your Lord for forgiveness, then turn to Him penitently. He \\nwill provide you with a good provision for a specified term and grant His grace to every meritorious \\nperson. But if you turn your backs [on Him], indeed I fear for you the punishment of a terrible day. (3) To \\nAllah will be your return, and He has power over all things.’ (4) Look! They fold up their breasts to hide \\n[their secret feelings] from Him. Look! When they draw their cloaks over their heads, He knows \\nwhatever they keep secret and whatever they disclose. Indeed, He knows best whatever is in the \\nbreasts. (5) There is no animal on the earth, but that its sustenance lies with Allah, and He knows its \\n[enduring] abode and its temporary place of lodging. Everything is in a manifest Book. (6) It is He who \\ncreated the heavens and the earth in six days —and His Throne was [then] upon the waters —that He \\nmay test you [to see] which of you is best in conduct. Yet if you say, ‘You will indeed be raised up after \\ndeath,’ the faithless will surely say, ‘This is nothing but plain magic.’ (7) And if We defer their \\npunishment until a certain time, they will surely say, ‘What holds it b ack?’ Look! On the day it overtakes \\nthem it shall not be turned away from them, and they will be besieged by what they used to deride. (8) \\nIf We let man taste a mercy from Us, and then withdraw it from him, he becomes despondent, \\nungrateful. (9) And if We let him have a taste of Our blessings after adversities have befallen him, he will \\nsurely say, ‘All ills have left me.’ Indeed, he becomes a vain braggart, (10) excepting those who are \\npatient and do righteous deeds. For such there will be forgiveness and a great reward. (11) [Look out] \\nlest you should disregard aught of what has been revealed to you, and be upset because they say, ‘Why \\nhas not a treasure been sent down to him, or *why does+ not an angel accompany him?’ You are only a \\nwarner, and Allah watc hes over all things. (12) Do they say, ‘He has fabricated it?’ Say, ‘Then bring ten \\nsurahs like it, fabricated, and invoke whomever you can, besides Allah, should you be truthful.’ (13) But \\nif they do not respond to you, know that it has been sent down by Allah’s knowledge, and that there is \\nno god except Him. Will you, then, submit [to Allah]? (14) As for those who desire the life of this world \\nand its glitter, We will recompense them fully for their works therein, and they shall not be underpaid in \\nit. (1 5) They are the ones for whom there shall be nothing in the Hereafter but Fire: what they had \\naccomplished in the world has failed, and their works have come to naught. (16) Is he who stands on a \\nmanifest proof from his Lord, and whom a witness of his own [family] follows? And before him there \\nwas the Book of Moses, a guide and mercy. It is they who have faith in it, and whoever defies him from \\namong the factions, the Fire is their tryst. So do not be in doubt about it; it is the truth from your Lord, \\nbut m ost people do not have faith. (17) Who is a greater wrongdoer than him who fabricates a lie \\nagainst Allah? Such shall be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, ‘It is these who lied \\nagainst their Lord.’ Behold! The curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers (18) —those who bar [others] \\nfrom the way of Allah, and seek to make it crooked, and disbelieve in the Hereafter. (19) They cannot \\nfrustrate [Allah] on the earth, nor do they have besides Allah any guardian. For them the punishment \\nshall be doubled, for they could neither listen, nor did they use to see. (20) They are the ones who have \\nruined their souls, and what they used to fabricate has forsaken them. (21) Undoubtedly, they are the \\nones who will be the biggest losers in the Hereafter. (22 ) Indeed those who have faith and do righteous \\ndeeds and are humble before their Lord —they shall be the inhabitants of paradise, and they shall \\nremain in it [forever].

Indeed I fear for you the punishment of a painful day. ’ (26) But the elite of the faithless from \\namong his people said, ‘We do not see you to be anything but a human being like ourselves, and we do \\nnot see anyone following you except those who are simpleminded riffraff from our midst. Nor do we see \\nthat you h ave any merit over us. Indeed, we consider you to be liars.’ (27) He said, ‘O my people! Tell \\nme, should I stand on a manifest proof from my Lord, and He has granted me His own mercy —though it \\nshould be invisible to you—shall we force it upon you while you  are averse to it? (28) O my people! I do \\nnot ask you any material reward for it. My reward lies only with Allah. But I will not drive away those \\nwho have faith: they will indeed encounter their Lord. But I see that you are an ignorant lot. (29) O my \\npeople! Who would come to my help against Allah were I to drive them away? Will you not then take \\nadmonition? (30) I do not say to you that I possess the treasuries of Allah, neither do I know the Unseen. \\nI do not claim to be an angel, neither do I say of those who are despicable in your eyes that Allah will not \\ngrant them any good —Allah knows best what is in their hearts —for then I would indeed be a \\nwrongdoer.’ (31) They said, ‘O Noah, you have disputed with us already, and you have disputed with us \\nexceedingly. Now bring us what you threaten us with, should you be truthful. (32) He said, ‘Allah will \\nindeed bring it on you if He wishes, and you cannot frustrate [Him]. (33) My exhorting will not benefit \\nyou, much as I may seek to exhort you, if Allah desires to c onsign you to perversity. He is your Lord, and \\nto Him you shall be brought back.’ (34) Do they say, ‘He has fabricated it?’ Say, ‘Should I have fabricated \\nit, then my guilt will be upon me, and I am absolved of your guilty conduct.’ (35) It was revealed to  \\nNoah: ‘None of your people will believe except those who already have faith; so do not sorrow for what \\nthey used to do. (36) Build the ark before Our eyes and by Our revelation, and do not plead with Me for \\nthose who are wrongdoers: they shall indeed be d rowned.’ (37) As he was building the ark, whenever \\nthe elders of his people passed by him, they would ridicule him. He said, ‘If you ridicule us *today+, we \\nshall ridicule you [tomorrow] just as you ridicule us [now]. (38) Soon you will know whom a disgrac eful \\npunishment will overtake and on whom a lasting punishment will descend.’ (39) When Our edict came \\nand the oven gushed *a stream of water+, We said, ‘Carry in it a pair of every kind *of animal+, along with \\nyour family—except those [of them] against wh om the edict has already been given —and those who \\nhave faith.’ And none believed with him except a few. (40) He said, ‘Board it: In the Name of Allah it shall \\nset sail and cast anchor. Indeed my Lord is all -forgiving, all-merciful.’ (41) And it sailed alon g with them \\namid waves *rising+ like mountains. Noah called out to his son, who stood aloof, ‘O my son! ‘Board with \\nus, and do not be with the faithless!’ (42) He said, ‘I shall take refuge on a mountain; it will protect me \\nfrom the flood.’ He said, ‘There is none today who can protect from Allah’s edict, except someone upon \\nwhom He has mercy.’ Then the waves came between them, and he was among those who were \\ndrowned. (43) Then it was said, ‘O earth, swallow your water! O sky, leave off!’ The waters receded ; the \\nedict was carried out, and it settled on *Mount+ Judi. Then it was said, ‘Away with the wrongdoing lot!’ \\n(44) Noah called out to his Lord, and said, ‘My Lord! My son is indeed from my family.

So do not ask Me [something] of which you have \\nno knowledge. I advise you lest you should be among the ignorant.’ (46) He said, ‘My Lord!

So do not turn your backs [on Him] as guilty \\nones.’ (52) They said, ‘O Hud, you have not brought us any manifest proof. We are not going to abandon \\nour gods for what you say, and we are not going to believe you. (53) All we say is that some of our gods \\nhave visited you with some evil.’ He said, ‘I call Allah to witness —and you too be [my] witnesses —that I \\nrepudiate what you take as [His] partners (54) besides Him. Now try out your stratagems against m e, \\ntogether, without granting me any respite. (55) Indeed I have put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your \\nLord. There is no living being but He holds it by its forelock. Indeed my Lord is on a straight path. (56) But \\nif you turn your backs [on me], then [know that] I have communicated to you whatever I was sent to you \\nwith. My Lord will make another people succeed you, and you will not hurt Allah in the least. Indeed my \\nLord is watchful over all things.’ (57) When Our edict came, We delivered Hud and the faithful who were \\nwith him, by a mercy from Us, and We delivered them from a harsh punishment. (58) Such were [the \\npeople of] Ad: they impugned the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His apostles, and followed the \\ndictates of every obstinate tyrant.

So plead with Him for \\nforgiveness, then turn to Him penitently. My Lord is indeed nearmost *and+ responsive.’ (61) They said, \\n‘O Salih! You were a source of hope to us before this. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers have \\nbeen worshiping? Indeed we have grave doubts concerning that to which you invite us.’ (62) He said, ‘O \\nmy people! Tell me, should I stand on a manifest proof from my Lord, and He has granted me His own \\nmercy, who will protect me from Allah should I disobey Him? For then you will increase me in nothing \\nbut loss. (63) O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a sign for you. Let her graze *freely+ in Allah’s land, \\nand do not cause her any harm, for then you shall be seized by a prompt punishment.’ (64) But they \\nhamstrung her, whereupon he said, ‘Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days: that is a promise \\nnot to be belied!’ (65) So when Our edict came, We delivered Salih and the faithful who were with  him \\nby a mercy from Us and from the [punishment and] disgrace of that day. Your Lord is indeed the All -\\nstrong, the All-mighty. (66) The Cry seized those who were wrongdoers, and they lay lifeless prostrate in \\ntheir homes, (67) as if they had never lived t here. Behold! Thamud indeed defied their Lord. Now, away \\nwith Thamud! (68) Certainly Our messengers came to Abraham with the good news, and said, ‘Peace!’ \\n‘Peace!’ He replied. Presently he brought *for them+ a roasted calf. (69) But when he saw their hands not \\nreaching for it, he took them amiss and felt a fear of them. They said, ‘Do not be afraid.

These are the signs of the Manifest Book. (1) Indeed We have sent it down as an Arabic \\nQuran so that y ou may exercise your reason. (2) We will recount to you the best of narratives in what \\nWe have revealed to you of this Quran, and indeed prior to it you were among those who are unaware \\n*of it+. (3) When Joseph said to his father, ‘Father! I saw eleven planets, and the sun and the moon: I saw \\nthem prostrating themselves before me,’ (4) he said, ‘My son, do not recount your dream to your \\nbrothers, lest they should devise schemes against you. Satan is indeed man’s manifest enemy. (5) That is \\nhow your Lord wil l choose you, and teach you the interpretation of dreams, and complete His blessing \\nupon you and upon the house of Jacob, just as He completed it earlier for your fathers, Abraham and \\nIsaac. Your Lord is indeed all -knowing and all -wise.’ (6) In Joseph and his brothers there are certainly \\nsigns for the seekers. (7) When they said, ‘Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than \\n*the rest of+ us, though we are a hardy band. Our father is indeed in manifest error.’ (8) ‘Kill Joseph or \\ncast him away into some *distant+ land, so that your father’s attention may be exclusively towards you, \\nand thereafter you may become a righteous lot.’ (9) One of them said, ‘Do not kill Joseph, but cast him \\ninto the recess of a well so that some caravan may pick him up, if you are to do *anything+.’ (10) They \\nsaid, ‘Father! Why is it that you do not trust us with Joseph? We are indeed his well -wishers. (11) Let \\nhim go with us tomorrow so that he may eat lots of fruits and play, and we will indeed take [good] care \\nof him.’ (12) He said, ‘It really upsets me that you should take him away, and I fear the wolf may eat him \\nwhile you are oblivious of him.’ (13) They said, ‘Should the wolf eat him while we are a hardy band, then \\nwe will indeed be losers!’ (14) So when they took him away and conspired to put him into the recess of a \\nwell, We revealed to him, ‘*A day will come when+ you will surely inform them about this affair of theirs \\nwhile they are not aware *of your identity+.’ (15) In the evening, they came weeping to thei r father. (16) \\nThey said, ‘Father! We had gone racing and left Joseph with our things, whereat the wolf ate him. But \\nyou will not believe us even if we spoke truly.’ (17) And they produced sham blood on his shirt. He said, \\n‘No, your souls have made a matte r seem decorous to you. Yet patience is graceful, and Allah is my \\nresort against what you allege.’ (18) There came a caravan, and they sent their water -drawer, who let \\ndown his bucket. ‘Good news!’ he said. ‘This is a young boy!’ So they hid him as *a piec e of] \\nmerchandise, and Allah knew best what they were doing. (19) And they sold him for a cheap price, a few \\ndirhams, for they set small store by him. (20) The man from Egypt who had bought him said to his wife, \\n‘Give him an honourable place *in the househ old]. Maybe he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him \\nas a son.’ Thus We established Joseph in the land and that We might teach him the interpretation of \\ndreams. Allah has [full] command of His affairs, but most people do not know. (21) When he came of \\nage, We gave him judgement and [sacred] knowledge, and thus do We reward the virtuous. (22) The \\nwoman in whose house he was, solicited him. She closed the doors and said, ‘Come!!’ He said, ‘God \\nforbid! Indeed He is my Lord; He has given me a good abode. In deed the wrongdoers are not felicitous.’ \\n(23) She certainly made for him; and he would have made for her [too] had he not beheld the proof of \\nhis Lord. So it was, that We might turn away from him all evil and indecency. He was indeed one of Our \\ndedicated servants. (24) They raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from behind, and they ran into \\nher husband at the door. She said, ‘What is to be the requital of him who has evil intentions for your \\nwife except imprisonment or a painful punishment?’ (25) He sa id, ‘It was she who solicited me.’ A \\nwitness of her own household testified *thus+: ‘If his shirt is torn from the front, she tells the truth and \\nhe lies.

Your guile is indeed \\ngreat! (28) Joseph, let this matter alone, and you, woman, plead for forgiveness for your sin, for you \\nhave indeed been erring.’ (29) Some of the to wnswomen said, ‘The chieftain’s wife has solicited her \\nslave boy! He has captivated her love. Indeed we see her to be in manifest error.’ (30)  When she heard \\nof their machinations, she sent for them and arranged a repast, and gave each of them a knife, and  said \\n*to Joseph+, ‘Come out before them.’ So when they saw him, they marvelled at him and cut their hands \\n[absent-mindedly+, and they said, ‘Good heavens! This is not a human being! This is but a noble angel!’ \\n(31) She said, ‘He is the one on whose accoun t you blamed me. Certainly, I did solicit him, but he was \\ncontinent, and if he does not do what I bid him, surely he shall be imprisoned and humbled.’ (32) He \\nsaid, ‘My Lord! The prison is dearer to me than to what they invite me. If You do not turn away t heir \\nschemes from me, I will incline towards them and become one of the senseless.’ (33) So his Lord \\nanswered him and turned away their stratagems from him. Indeed, He is the All -hearing, the All -\\nknowing. (34) Then it appeared to them, after they had seen all the signs [of his innocence], that they \\nshould confine him for some time. (35) There entered the prison two youths along with him. One of \\nthem said, ‘I dreamt that I am pressing grapes.’ The other said, ‘I dreamt that I am carrying bread on my \\nhead from which the birds are eating.’ ‘Inform us of its interpretation,’ *they said+, ‘for indeed we see \\nyou to be a virtuous man.’ (36) He said, ‘Before the meals you are served come to you I will inform you \\nof its interpretation. That is among things my Lord ha s taught me. Indeed, I renounce the creed of the \\npeople who have no faith in Allah and who [also] disbelieve in the Hereafter. (37) I follow the creed of \\nmy fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It is not for us to ascribe any partner to Allah. That is by vir tue of \\nAllah’s grace upon us and upon all mankind, but most people do not give thanks. (38) O my prison \\nmates! Are different masters better, or Allah, the One, the All -paramount? (39) You do not worship \\nbesides Him but [mere] names that you and your fathers have coined, for which Allah has not sent down \\nany authority. Sovereignty belongs only to Allah. He has commanded you to worship none except Him. \\nThat is the upright religion, but most people do not know. (40) O my prison mates! As for one of you, he \\nwill serve wine to his master, and as for the other, he will be crucified and vultures will eat from his \\nhead. The matter about which you inquire has been decided.’ (41) Then he said to the one whom he \\nknew would be delivered from among the two: ‘Mention me t o your master.’ But Satan caused him to \\nforget mentioning [it] to his master. So he remained in the prison for several years. (42) [One day] the \\nking said, ‘I saw *in a dream+ seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean ones, and seven green ears \\nand [seve n] others [that were] dry. O courtiers, give me your opinion about my dream, if you can \\ninterpret dreams.’ (43) They said, ‘*These are+ confused nightmares, and we do not know the \\ninterpretation of nightmares.’ (44) Said the one of the two who had been del ivered, remembering \\n*Joseph+ after a long time: ‘I will inform you of its interpretation; so let me go *to meet Joseph in the \\nprison+.’ (45) ‘Joseph,’ *he said+, ‘O truthful one, give us your opinion concerning seven fat cows who are \\neaten by seven lean on es, and seven green ears and [seven] others dry, that I may return to the people \\nso that they may know *the truth of the matter+.’ (46) He said, ‘You will sow for seven consecutive years. \\nThen leave in the ear whatever [grain] you harvest, except a little that you eat. (47) Then after that there \\nwill come seven hard years which will eat up whatever you have set aside for them —all except a little \\nwhich you preserve [for seed]. (48) Then after that there will come a year wherein the people will be \\ngranted rel ief and provided with rains therein. (49) The king said, ‘Bring him to me!’ When the \\nmessenger came to him, he said, ‘Go back to your master, and ask him about the affair of women who \\ncut their hands.

It was I who solicited him, and he is \\nindeed telling the truth. ’ (51) *Joseph said+, *‘I initiated+ this *inquiry+, that he may know that I did not \\nbetray him in his absence, and that Allah does not further the schemes of the treacherous.’ (52) ‘Yet I do \\nnot absolve my [own carnal] soul, for the [carnal] soul indeed prompts [men] to evil, except inasmuch as \\nmy Lord has mercy. Indeed my Lord is all -forgiving, all-merciful.’ (53) The king said, ‘Bring him to me, I \\nwill make him my favourite.’ Then, when he had spoken with him, he said, ‘Indeed today *onwards+ you \\nwill be honoured and trustworthy with us.’ (54) He said, ‘Put me in charge of the country’s granaries. I \\nam indeed fastidious [and]well -informed.’ (55) That is how We established Joseph in the land that he \\nmay settle in it wherever he wished. We confer Our mercy on whomever We wish, and We do not waste \\nthe reward of the virtuous. (56) And the reward of the Hereafter is surely better for those who have \\nfaith and are Godwary. (57) [After some years] the brothers of Joseph came and entered his presence. \\nHe recognized  them, but they did not recognize him. (58) When he had furnished them with their \\nprovision, he said, ‘Bring me a brother that you have through your father. Do you not see that I give the \\nfull measure and that I am the best of hosts? (59) But if you do not  bring him to me, then there will be \\nno rations for you with me, and don’t *ever+ come near me.’ (60) They said, ‘We will solicit him from his \\nfather. *That+ we will surely do.’ (61) He said to his servants, ‘Put their money *back+ into their \\nsaddlebags. Maybe they will recognize it when they return to their folks, and maybe they will come back \\n*again+.’ (62) So when they returned to their father, they said, ‘Father, the measure has been withheld \\nfrom us, so let our brother go with us so that we may obtain the measure, and we will indeed take \\n*good+ care of him.’ (63) He said, ‘Should I not trust you with him just as I trusted you with his brother \\nbefore? Yet Allah is the best of protectors, and He is the most merciful of merciful ones.’ (64) And when \\nthey opened their baggage, they found their money restored to them. They said, ‘Father, what *more+ \\ndo we want?! This is our money, restored to us! We will get provisions for our family and take care of \\nour brother, and add another camel -load of rations. These a re meagre rations.’ (65) He said, ‘I will not \\nlet him go with you until you give me a [solemn] pledge by Allah that you will surely bring him back to \\nme, unless you are made to perish.’ When they had given him their *solemn+ pledge, he said, ‘Allah is \\nwitness over what we say.’ (66) And he said, ‘My sons, do not enter by one gate, but enter by separate \\ngates, though I cannot avail you anything against Allah. Sovereignty belongs only to Allah. In Him I have \\nput my trust; and in Him let all the trusting put t heir trust.’ (67) When they entered whence their father \\nhad bidden them, it did not avail them anything against Allah, but only fulfilled a wish in Jacob’s heart. \\nIndeed, he had the knowledge of what We had taught him, but most people do not know. (68) Whe n \\nthey entered into the presence of Joseph, he set his brother close to himself, and said, ‘Indeed I am your \\nbrother, so do not sorrow for what they used to do.’ (69) When he had furnished them with their \\nprovision, he put the drinking -cup into his brother ’s saddlebag. Then a herald shouted: ‘O *men of the+ \\ncaravan! You are indeed thieves!’ (70) They said, as they turned towards them, ‘What are you missing?’ \\n(71) They said, ‘We miss the king’s goblet.’ ‘Whoever brings it shall have a camel -load *of grain+,’  [said \\nthe steward+, ‘I will guarantee that.’ (72) They said, ‘By Allah! You certainly know that we did not come \\nto make trouble in this country, and we are not thieves.’ (73) They said, ‘What shall be its requital if you \\n*prove to+ be lying?’ (74) They sa id, ‘The requital for it shall be that he in whose saddlebag it is found \\nshall give himself over as its requital. Thus do we requite the wrongdoers.’ (75) Then he began with their \\nsacks, before *opening+ his brother’s sack. Then he took it out from his bro ther’s sack. Thus did We \\ndevise for Joseph’s sake. He could not have held his brother under the king’s law unless Allah willed \\n[otherwise]. We raise in rank whomever We please, and above every man of knowledge is One who \\nknows best.

Indeed no  one despairs \\nof Allah’s mercy except the faithless lot.’ (87) Then, when they entered into his presence, they said, ‘O \\nemir!

Indeed Allah rewards the charitable.’ (88) He said, ‘Have you \\nrealized what you did to Joseph and his brother, when you were senseless?’ (89) They said, ‘Are you \\nreally Joseph?!’ He said, ‘I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Certainly Allah has sh own us favour. \\nIndeed if one is Godwary and patient Allah does not waste the reward of the virtuous.’ (90) They said, \\n‘By Allah, Allah has certainly preferred you over us, and we have indeed been erring.’ (91) He said, \\n‘There shall be no reproach on you to day. Allah will forgive you, and He is the most merciful of the \\nmerciful.

Only those who possess intellect take admonition (19) —those who fulfill Allah’s \\ncovenant an d do not break the pledge solemnly made, (20) and those who join what Allah has \\ncommanded to be joined, and fear their Lord, and are afraid of an adverse reckoning (21) —those who \\nare patient for the sake of their Lord’s pleasure, maintain the prayer, and spend secretly and openly out \\nof what We have provided them, and repel evil [conduct] with good. For such will be the reward of the \\n[ultimate] abode: (22) the Gardens of Eden, which they will enter along with whoever is righteous from \\namong their forebears, their spouses, and their descendants, and the angels will call on them from every \\ndoor: (23) ‘Peace be to you, for your patience.’ How excellent is the reward of the *ultimate+ abode! (24) \\nBut as for those who break Allah’s compact after having pledged i t solemnly, and sever what Allah has \\ncommanded to be joined, and cause corruption in the earth —it is such on whom the curse will lie, and \\nfor them will be the ills of the [ultimate] abode. (25) Allah expands the provision for whomever He \\nwishes, and tightens it. They boast of the life of this world, but compared with the Hereafter the life of \\nthis world is but a *trifling+ enjoyment. (26) The faithless say, ‘Why has not some sign been sent down to \\nhim from his Lord?’ Say, ‘Indeed Allah leads astray whomever  He wishes, and guides to Himself those \\nwho turn penitently [to Him] (27) —those who have faith and whose hearts find rest in the \\nremembrance of Allah.’ Behold! The hearts find rest in Allah’s remembrance! (28) Those who have faith \\nand do righteous deeds —happy are they and good is their [ultimate] destination. (29) Thus have We \\nsent you to a nation before which many nations have passed away, that you may recite to them what \\nWe have revealed to you. Yet they defy the All -beneficent. Say, ‘He is my Lord; ther e is no god except \\nHim; in Him I have put my trust, and to Him will be my return.’ (30) If only it were a Quran whereby the \\nmountains could be moved, or the earth could be toured, or the dead could be spoken to.... Indeed, all \\ndispensation belongs to Allah . Have not the faithful yet realised that had Allah wished He would have \\nguided mankind all together? The faithless will continue to be visited by catastrophes because of their \\ndoings—or they will land near their habitations —until Allah’s promise comes to pass. Indeed Allah does \\nnot break His promise. (31) Apostles were certainly derided before you. But then I gave respite to those \\nwho were faithless, then I seized them; so how was My retribution? (32) Is He who sustains every soul in \\nspite of what it earns  *comparable to the idols+? Yet they ascribe partners to Allah! Say, ‘Name them!’ \\nWill you inform Him concerning something He does not know about on the earth, or concerning [what \\nare] mere words? Indeed, to the faithless, their scheming is presented as de corous, and they have been \\nbarred from the [right] way; and whomever Allah leads astray, has no guide. (33) There is a punishment \\nfor them in the life of this world, and the punishment of the Hereafter will surely be harder, and they \\nhave no defender again st Allah. (34) A description of the paradise promised to the Godwary: streams \\nrun in it, its fruits and shade are everlasting. Such is the requital of those who are Godwary; and the \\nrequital of the faithless is the Fire. (35) Those whom We have given the B ook rejoice in what has been \\nsent down to you. Some of the factions deny a part of it. Say, ‘Indeed I have been commanded to \\nworship Allah and not to ascribe any partner to Him. To Him do I summon [all mankind] and to Him will \\nbe my return.’ (36) Thus We h ave sent it down as a dispensation in Arabic; and should you follow their \\ndesires after the knowledge that has come to you, you shall have against Allah neither any guardian nor \\ndefender. (37) Certainly We have sent apostles before you, and We appointed fo r them wives and \\ndescendants; and an apostle may not bring a sign except by Allah’s leave.

(4) Certainly We sent Moses with Our signs: ‘Bring your people out from darkness \\ninto light and remind them of Allah’s *holy+ days. There are indeed signs in that for every patient and \\ngrateful *servant+.’ (5) When Moses said to his people, ‘Rem ember Allah’s blessing upon you when He \\ndelivered you from Pharaoh’s clan who inflicted a terrible torment on you, and slaughtered your sons \\nand spared your women, and in that there was a great test from your Lord. (6) And when your Lord \\nproclaimed, “If yo u are grateful, I will surely enhance you [in blessing], but if you are ungrateful, My \\npunishment is indeed severe.” ’ (7) And Moses said, ‘Should you be faithless, —you and everyone on the \\nearth, all together —indeed Allah is all -sufficient, all -laudable.’ (8) Has there not come to you the \\naccount of those who were before you —the people of Noah, ‘Ad and Thamud, and those who were \\nafter them, whom no one knows [well] except Allah? Their apostles brought them manifest proofs, but \\nthey did not respond to them, and said, ‘We disbelieve in what you have been sent with. Indeed we \\nhave grave doubts concerning that to which you invite us.’ (9) Their apostles said, ‘Is there any doubt \\nabout Allah, the originator of the heavens and the earth?! He calls you to forgive y ou a part of your sins, \\nand grants you respite until a specified time.’ They said, ‘You are nothing but humans like us who desire \\nto bar us from what our fathers used to worship. So bring us a manifest authority.’ (10) Their apostles \\nsaid to them, ‘Indeed we are just human beings like yourselves; but Allah favours whomever of His \\nservants that He wishes. We may not bring you an authority except by Allah’s leave, and in Allah let all \\nthe faithful put their trust. (11) And why should we not put our trust in A llah, seeing that He has guided \\nus in our ways? Surely, we will put up patiently with whatever torment you may inflict upon us, and in \\nAllah let all the trusting put their trust.’ (12) But the faithless said to their apostles, ‘Surely we will expel \\nyou from our land, or you shall revert to our creed.’ Thereat their Lord revealed to them: ‘We will surely \\ndestroy the wrongdoers, (13) and surely We will settle you in the land after them. This [promise] is for \\nsomeone who is awed to stand before Me and fears My threat.’ (14) They prayed for victory *against the \\ninfidels], and every obstinate tyrant was defeated, (15) with hell lying ahead of him, [where] he shall be \\ngiven to drink of a purulent fluid, (16) gulping it down, but hardly swallowing it: death will as sail him \\nfrom every side, but he will not die, and there is [yet] a harsh punishment ahead of him. (17) A parable \\nof those who defy their Lord: their deeds are like ashes over which the wind blows hard on a \\ntempestuous day: they have no power over anything they have earned. That is extreme error. (18) Have \\nyou not regarded that Allah created the heavens and the earth with justice? If He wishes, He will take \\nyou away, and bring about a new creation, (19) and that is not a formidable thing for Allah. (20) \\nTogether they will be presented before Allah. Then those who were weak will say to the arrogant \\n*leaders+, ‘Indeed we were your followers. So will you avail us against Allah’s punishment in any wise?’ \\nThey will say, ‘Had Allah guided us, surely we would have guided you.

(24) It gives its fruit every season by the leave of \\nits Lord. Allah draws these parables for mankind so that they may take admonition.

And He disposed the ships for you[r benefit] so \\nthat they may sail at sea by His command, and He disposed the rivers for you.

If you enumerate Allah’s blessings, you will not be able to count \\nthem. Indeed man is most unfair and ungrateful! (34) When Abraham said, ‘My Lord! Make this city a \\nsanctuary, and save me and my children from w orshiping idols. (35) My Lord! Indeed they have misled \\nmany people. So whoever follows me indeed belongs to me, and as for those who disobey me, well, You \\nare indeed all -forgiving, all-merciful. (36) Our Lord! I have settled part of my descendants in a bar ren \\nvalley, by Your sacred House, our Lord, that they may maintain the prayer. So make the hearts of a part \\nof the people fond of them, and provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks. (37) Our Lord! \\nIndeed You know whatever we hide and whatever  we disclose, and nothing is hidden from Allah on the \\nearth or in the sky. (38) All praise belongs to Allah, who gave me Ishmael and Isaac despite [my] old age. \\nIndeed my Lord hears all supplications. (39) My Lord! Make me a maintainer of prayer, and my \\ndescendants [as well]. Our Lord, accept my supplication. (40) Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and \\nall the faithful, on the day when the reckoning is held.’ (41) Do not suppose that Allah is oblivious of \\nwhat the wrongdoers are doing. He is only granting  them respite until the day when the eyes will be \\nglazed. (42) Scrambling with their heads upturned, there will be a fixed gaze in their eyes, and their \\nhearts will be vacant. (43) Warn the people of the day when the punishment will overtake them, \\nwhereat the wrongdoers will say, ‘Our Lord! Respite us for a short time so that we may respond to Your \\ncall and follow the apostles.’ *They will be told,+ ‘Did you not use to swear earlier that there would be no \\nreverse for you, (44) while you dwelt in the dwellin gs of those who had wronged themselves [before], \\nand it had been made clear to you how We had dealt with them [before you], and We had [also] cited \\nexamples for you?’ (45) They certainly devised their plots, but their plots are known to Allah, and their \\nplots are not such as to dislodge the mountains.

(13) It is He wh o disposed the sea [for your \\nbenefit] that you may eat from it fresh meat, and obtain from it ornaments which you wear, and you see \\nthe ships plowing through it, that you may seek His bounty and that you may give thanks. (14) He cast \\nfirm mountains in the earth lest it should shake with you, and [made] streams and ways, so that you \\nmay be guided (15) —and the landmarks [as well] —and by the stars they are guided. (16) Is He who \\ncreates like one who does not create? Will you not then take admonition? (17) If you enumerate Allah’s \\nblessings, you will not be able to count them. Indeed Allah is all -forgiving, all-merciful, (18) and Allah \\nknows whatever you hide and whatever you disclose. (19) Those whom they invoke besides Allah do not \\ncreate anything and are the mselves created. (20) They are dead and lifeless, and are not aware when \\nthey will be resurrected. (21) Your God is the One God. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter, their \\nhearts are in denial [of the truth], and they are arrogant. (22) Undoubtedly, Allah knows whatever they \\nhide and whatever they disclose. Indeed, He does not like the arrogant. (23) When they are asked, \\n‘What is it that your Lord has sent down?’ They say, ‘Myths of the ancients,’ (24) *with the result+ that \\nthey will bear the full we ight of their own burden on the Day of Resurrection, along with part of the \\nburden of those whom they mislead without any knowledge.

(26) Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will disgrace them, and say, ‘Where are My “partners” \\nfor whose sake you used to defy [Allah]? ’ Those who were given knowledge will say, ‘Indeed today \\ndisgrace and distress pursue the faithless.’ (27) —Those whom the angels take away while they were \\nwronging themselves.

Enter paradise because of what you used to \\ndo.’ (32) Do they not consider that the angels may come to them, or your Lord’s edict may come? Those \\nwho were before them had acted likewise; Allah did not wrong them, but they used to wrong \\nthemselves. (33) So the evils of what they had earned visited them, and they were besieged by what \\nthey used to deride. (34) The polytheists say, ‘Had Allah wished, we would not have worshiped anything \\nbesides Him —neither we, nor our fathers —nor we would have forbidden anything without His \\nsanction.’ Those who were before them had acted likewise. Is the apostles’ du ty anything but to \\ncommunicate in clear terms? (35) Certainly We raised an apostle in every nation *to preach:+ ‘Worship \\nAllah, and shun fake deities.’ Among them were some whom Allah guided, and among them were some \\nwho deserved to be in error. So travel over the land and observe how was the fate of the deniers. (36) \\nEven if you are eager for them to be guided, indeed Allah does not guide those who mislead [others], \\nand they will have no helpers. (37) They swear by Allah with solemn oaths that Allah will n ot resurrect \\nthose who die. Yes indeed [He will], it is a promise binding upon Him, but most people do not know, (38) \\nso that He may clarify for them what they differ about, and that the faithless may know that they were \\nliars. (39) All that We say to a thing, when We will it, is to say to it ‘Be!’ and it is. (40) Those who migrate \\nfor the sake of Allah after they have been wronged, We will surely settle them in a good place in the \\nworld, and the reward of the Hereafter is surely greater, had they known (41 ) —those who are patient \\nand who put their trust in their Lord. (42) We did not send [any apostles] before you except as men to \\nwhom We revealed. Ask the People of the Reminder if you do not know. (43) [We sent them] with \\nmanifest proofs and scriptures. We  have sent down the reminder to you so that you may clarify for the \\npeople that which has been sent down to them, so that they may reflect. (44) Do those who devise evil \\nschemes feel secure that Allah will not make the earth swallow them, or the punishment  will not \\novertake them whence they are not aware? (45) Or that He will not seize them in the midst of their \\nbustle, whereupon they will not be able to frustrate [Him]? (46) Or that He will not visit them with \\nattrition? Indeed your Lord is most kind and m erciful. (47) Have they not regarded that whatever thing \\nAllah has created casts its shadow to the right and to the left, prostrating to Allah in utter humility? (48) \\nTo Allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, including an imals and \\nangels, and they are not arrogant. (49) They fear their Lord above them, and do what they are \\ncommanded. (50) Allah has said, ‘Do not worship two gods. Indeed He is the One God, so be in awe of \\nMe *alone+.’ (51) To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and to Him belongs the \\nenduring religion. Will you, then, be wary of other than Allah? (52) Whatever blessing you have is from \\nAllah, and when a distress befalls you, you make entreaties to Him. (53) Then, when He removes the \\ndistress from you—behold, a part of them ascribe partners to their Lord, (54) being unthankful for what \\nWe have given them. So let them enjoy. Soon they shall know! (55) They assign a share in what We have \\nprovided them to what they do not know. By Allah, you wil l surely be questioned concerning what you \\nused to fabricate. (56) And they attribute daughters to Allah —immaculate is He —while they will have \\nwhat they desire! (57) When one of them is brought the news of a female [newborn], his face becomes \\ndarkened, and he chokes with suppressed agony. (58) He hides from the people out of distress at the \\nnews he has been brought: shall he retain it in humiliation, or bury it in the ground! Behold! Evil is the \\njudgement that they make.

(71) Allah made for you mates from your own selves and appointed for you children \\nand grandchildren from your mates, and We provided you with all the good things. What, do they \\nbelieve in falsehood while they deny the blessing of Allah? (72) They worship besides Allah what has no \\npower to provide them with anything from the heavens and the earth, nor are they capable [of \\nanything]. (73) So do not draw comparisons for Allah: indeed Allah knows and you do not know. (74) \\nAllah draws a parable: a slave owned [by his master] who has no power over anything, and another one \\n[a free man] whom We have provided a goodly provision and who spends out of it secretly and openly. \\nAre they equal? All praise belongs to Allah. But most of them do not know. (75) Allah draws [another] \\nparable: Two men, one of whom is dumb, having no power over anything and who is a liability to his \\nmaster: wherever he directs him he does not bring any good. Is he equal to someone who enjoins justice \\nand is [steady] on a straig ht path? (76) To Allah belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. The \\nmatter of the Hour is just like the twinkling of an eye, or [even] swifter. Indeed Allah has power over all \\nthings.

Indeed, He is the \\nAll-hearing, the All-seeing. (1) We gave Moses the Book, and made it a guide for the Children of Israel —\\n*saying,+ ‘Do not take any trustee besides Me’ — (2) descendants of those whom We carried [in the ark] \\nwith No ah. Indeed, he was a grateful servant. (3) We revealed to the Children of Israel in the Book: \\n‘Twice you will cause corruption on the earth, and you will perpetrate great tyranny.’ (4) So when the \\nfirst occasion of the two [prophecies] came, We aroused aga inst you Our servants possessing great \\nmight, and they ransacked [your] habitations, and the promise was bound to be fulfilled. (5) Then We \\ngave you back the turn [to prevail] over them, and We aided you with children and wealth, and made \\nyou greater in number, (6) *saying,+ ‘If you do good, you will do good to your *own+ souls, and if you do \\nevil, it will be *evil+ for them.’ So when the occasion for the other *prophecy+ comes, they will make your \\nfaces wretched, and enter the Temple just as they entered it the first time, and destroy utterly whatever \\nthey come upon. (7) Maybe your Lord will have mercy on you, but if you revert, We [too] will revert, and \\nWe have made hell a prison for the faithless. (8) Indeed this Quran guides to what is most upright, and \\ngives the good news to the faithful who do righteous deeds that there is a great reward for them. (9) As \\nfor those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have prepared a painful punishment for them. (10) \\nMan prays for ill as [avidly as] he prays for good,  and man is overhasty. (11) We made the night and the \\nday two signs. Then We faded out the sign of the night, and made the sign of the day lightsome, so that \\nyou may seek from your Lord’s bounty and that you may know the number of years and calculation *of  \\ntime+, and We have elaborated everything in detail. (12) We have attached every person’s omen to his \\nneck, and We shall bring it out for him on the Day of Resurrection as a book that he will find wide open. \\n(13) ‘Read your book! Today your soul suffices a s your own reckoner.’ (14) Whoever is guided is guided \\nonly for [the good of] his own soul, and whoever goes astray, goes astray only to its detriment. No \\nbearer shall bear another’s burden. We do not punish *any community+ until We have sent *it+ an \\napostle. (15) And when We desire to destroy a town We command its affluent ones [to obey Allah]. But \\nthey commit transgression in it, and so the word becomes due against it, and We destroy it utterly. (16) \\nHow many generations We have destroyed since Noah! Your  Lord is sufficient as [a witness who is] well \\naware and percipient of His servants’ sins. (17) Whoever desires this transitory life, We expedite for him \\ntherein whatever We wish, for whomever We desire. Then We appoint hell for him, to enter it, blameful \\nand spurned.

(20) Observe how \\nWe have given some of them an advantage over some others; yet the Hereafter is surely greater in \\nrespect of ranks and greater in respect of relative merit. (21) Do not set up another god besides Allah, or \\nyou will sit blameworthy, forsaken.

Should any of them or both reach old age at your side, \\ndo not say to them, ‘Fie!’ And do not chide them, but speak to them noble words.

(46) We know best what they listen for, \\nwhen they listen to you, and when they hold their secret talks, when the wrongdoe rs say, ‘*If you follow \\nhim+ You will be following just a bewitched man.’ (47) Look, how they coin epithets for you; so they go \\nastray, and cannot find a way. (48) They say, ‘What, when we have become bones and dust, shall we \\nreally be raised in a new crea tion?’ (49) Say, ‘*That is bound to happen+ even if you should become \\nstones, or iron, (50) or a creature more fantastic to your minds!’ They will say, ‘Who will bring us back?’ \\nSay, ‘He who originated you the first time.’ They will nod their heads at you,  and say, ‘When will that \\nbe?’ Say, ‘Maybe it is near! (51) The day He calls you, you will respond to Him, praising Him, and you will \\nthink you remained *in the world+ only for a little while.’ (52) Tell My servants to speak in a manner \\nwhich is the best. Indeed Satan incites ill feeling between them, and Satan is indeed man’s manifest \\nenemy. (53) Your Lord knows you best. He will have mercy on you if He wishes, or punish you, if He \\nwishes, and We did not send you to watch over them. (54) Your Lord knows be st whoever is in the \\nheavens and the earth. Certainly, We gave some prophets an advantage over the others, and We gave \\nDavid the Psalms. (55) Say, ‘Invoke those whom you claim *to be gods+ besides Him. They have no power \\nto remove your distress, nor to bri ng about any change [in your state]. (56) They [themselves] are the \\nones who supplicate, seeking a recourse to their Lord, whoever is nearer [to Him], expecting His mercy \\nand fearing His punishment.’ Indeed your Lord’s punishment is a thing to beware of.

(60) When We \\nsaid to the angels, ‘Prostrate before Adam,’ they *all+ prostrated, but not Iblis: he said, ‘Shall I prostrate \\nbefore someone whom You have c reated from clay?’ (61) Said he, ‘Do You see this one whom You have \\nhonoured above me?

(68) Do you feel secure that He will not send you back into it another \\ntime and unleash against you a shattering gale and drown you because of your unfaith?

(71) But whoever has been blind in this \\n[world], will be blind in the Hereafter, and [even] more astray from the [right] way. (72) They were \\nabout to beguile you from what Allah has revealed to you so that you may fabricate something other \\nthan that against Us, whereat they would have b efriended you. (73) And had We not fortified you, \\ncertainly you might have inclined toward them a bit. (74) Then We would have surely made you taste a \\ndouble [punishment] in this life and a double [punishment] after death, and then you would have not \\nfound for yourself any helper against Us. (75) They were about to hound you out of the land, to expel \\nyou from it, but then they would not have stayed after you but a little.

(97) That is their requital because they defied Our signs \\nand said, ‘What, when we have become bones and dust, shall we really be raised in a new creation?’ \\n(98) Do they not see that Allah, who created the heavens and the earth, is able to create the like of \\nthem?

(99) Say, ‘Even if you possessed the treasuries of my Lord’s mercy, you would withhold \\nthem for the fear of being spent, and man is very niggardly.’ (100) Certainly We gave Moses nine \\nmanifest signs. So ask the Children of Israel. When he came to them, Pharaoh said to him, ‘O Moses, \\nindeed I think you are bewitched.’ (101) He said, ‘You certainly know that no one has sent these *signs+ \\nexcept the Lord of the heavens and the earth, as eye -openers, and I, O Pharaoh, indeed think you are \\ndoomed.’ (102) He desired to exterminate them from the land, so We drowned him and all those who \\nwere with him. (103) After him We said to the Children of Israel, ‘Take up residence in the land, and \\nwhen the occasion of the other [promise] comes, We shall gathe r you in mixed company.’ (104) With \\nthe truth did We send it down, and with the truth did it descend, and We did not send you except as a \\nbearer of good news and as a warner.

(7) And indeed We will turn whatever is on it into a barren plain. (8) Do \\nyou suppose that the Companions of the Cave and the Inscription were among Our wonderful signs? (9) \\nWhen the youths took refuge in the Cave, they said, ‘Our Lord! Grant us a mercy from Yourself, and help \\nus on to rectitude in our affair.’ (10) So We put them to sleep in the Cave for several years. (11) Then We \\naroused them that We might know which of the two groups better reckoned the period they had stayed. \\n(12) We relate to you their account in truth. They were indeed youths who had faith in their Lord, and \\nWe had enhanced them in guidance, (13) and fortified their hearts, when they stood up and said, ‘Our \\nLord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never invoke any go d besides Him, for then we \\nshall certainly have said an atrocious lie. (14) These—our people—have taken gods besides Him. Why do \\nthey not bring any clear authority touching them? So who is a greater wrongdoer than he who fabricates \\na lie against Allah? (15 ) When you have dissociated yourselves from them and from what they worship \\nexcept Allah, then take refuge in the Cave. Your Lord will unfold His mercy for you, and He will help you \\non to ease in your affair.’ (16) You may see the sun, when it rises, slanting toward the right of their cave, \\nand, when it sets, cut across them towards the left, and they are in a cavern within it. That is one of \\nAllah’s signs. Whomever Allah guides is rightly guided, and whomever He leads astray, you will never \\nfind for him an y guardian or guide. (17) You will suppose them to be awake, although they are asleep. \\nWe turn them to the right and to the left, and their dog [lies] stretching its forelegs at the threshold. If \\nyou come upon them, you will surely turn to flee from them, and you will surely be filled with a terror of \\nthem. (18) So it was that We aroused them [from sleep] so that they might question one another. One \\nof them said, ‘How long have you stayed *here+?’ They said, ‘We have stayed a day, or part of a day.’ \\nThey said, ‘Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed. Send one of you to the city with this money. \\nLet him observe which of them has the purest food, and bring you provisions from there. Let him be \\nattentive, and let him not make anyone aware of you. (19) Indeed should they prevail over you, they will \\n*either+ stone you *to death+, or force you back into their creed, and then you will never be saved. ’ (20) \\nSo it was that We let them come upon them, that they might know that Allah’s promise is true, and that \\nthere is no doubt in the Hour. As they disputed among themselves about their matter, they said, ‘Build a \\nbuilding over them. Their Lord knows them best.’ Those who had the say in their matter said, ‘We will \\nset up a place of worship over them.’ (21) They w ill say, ‘*They are+ three; their dog is the fourth of \\nthem,’ and say, ‘*They are+ five, their dog is the sixth of them,’ taking a shot at the invisible. They will \\nsay, ‘*They are+ seven, their dog is the eighth of them.’ Say, ‘My Lord knows best their number, and none \\nknows them except a few.’ So do not dispute concerning them, except for a seeming dispute, and do not \\nquestion about them any of them. (22) Do not say about anything, ‘I will indeed do it tomorrow,’ (23) \\nwithout *adding+, ‘God willing.’ And when you forget, remember your Lord, and say, ‘Maybe my Lord will \\nguide me to *something+ more akin to rectitude than this.’ (24) They remained in the Cave for three'),\n",

(29) As for those who have faith and do \\nrighteous deeds—indeed We do not waste the reward of those who are good in deeds. (30) For such \\nthere will be the gardens of Eden with streams running in them.

He said, ‘I do not think that this will ever perish, (35) \\nand I do not think that the Hour will ever s et in. And even if I am returned to my Lord I will surely find a \\nresort better than this.’ (36) His companion said to him, as he conversed with him: ‘Do you disbelieve in \\nHim who created you from dust, then from a drop of [seminal] fluid, then fashioned yo u as a man? (37) \\nBut I *say+, ‘‘He is Allah, my Lord,’’ and I do not ascribe any partner to my Lord. (38) Why did you not say, \\nwhen you entered your garden, ‘‘*This is+ as Allah has willed! There is no power except by Allah!’’ If you \\nsee that I have lesser wealth than you and children, (39) maybe my Lord will give me [something] better \\nthan your garden, and He will unleash upon it bolts from the sky, so that it becomes a bare plain. (40) Or \\nits water will sink down, so that you will never be able to obtain it.’ (41) And ruin closed in on his \\nproduce, and he began to wring his hands for what he had spent on it, as it lay fallen on its trellises. He \\nwas saying, ‘I wish I had not ascribed any partner to my Lord.’ (42) He had no party to help him, besides \\nAllah, nor could he help himself.

(92) When he reached [the \\nplace] between the two barriers, he found between them a people who could hardly understand a word \\n*of his language+. (93) They said, ‘O Dhul Qarnayn! Indeed Gog and Magog are causin g disaster in this \\nland. Shall we pay you a tribute on condition that you build a barrier between them and us?’ (94) He \\nsaid, ‘What my Lord has furnished me is better.

(95) Bri ng me pieces of iron!’ When he had levelled up between the \\nflanks, he said, ‘Blow!’ When he had turned it into fire, he said, ‘Bring me molten copper to pour over it.’ \\n(96) So they could neither scale it, nor could they make a hole in it. (97) He said, ‘This is a mercy from my \\nLord. But when the promise of my Lord is fulfilled, He will level it; and my Lord’s promise is true.’ (98) \\nThat day We shall let them surge over one another, the Trumpet will be blown, and We shall gather \\nthem all, (99) and on that day We shall bring hell into view visibly for the faithless.

Indeed, We have prepared hell  for the hospitality of \\nthe faithless. (102) Say, ‘Shall we inform you who are the biggest losers in their works? (103) Those \\nwhose efforts are misguided in the life of the world, while they suppose they are doing good.’ (104) \\nThey are the ones who deny th e signs of their Lord and encounter with Him. So their works have failed. \\nOn the Day of Resurrection We will not give them any weight. (105) That is their requital—hell—because \\nof their unfaith and for deriding My signs and apostles.

Appoint a \\nsign for me.’ He said, ‘Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three complete nights. ’ (10) \\nSo he emerged before his people from the Temple, and signalled to them that they should glorify [Allah] \\nmorning and evening. (11) ‘O John!’ *We said,+ ‘Hold on with power to the Book!’ And We gave him \\njudgement while still a child, (12) and a compas sion and purity from Us.

Your  \\nLord says, ‘‘It is simple for Me.’’ And so that We may make him a sign for mankind and a mercy from Us, \\nand it is a matter *already+ decided.’ (21) Thus she conceived him, then withdrew with him to a distant \\nplace. (22) The birth pangs brought her to the trunk of a date palm.

(102) They \\nwill whisper to one another: ‘You have stayed only for ten *days+.’ (103) We know bes t what they will \\nsay, when the smartest of them in approach will say, ‘You stayed only a day!’ (104) They question you \\nconcerning the mountains. Say, ‘My Lord will scatter them *like dust+.’ (105) Then He will leave it a level \\nplain. (106) You will not see  any crookedness or unevenness in it. (107) On that day they will follow the \\nsummoner without zigzagging. Their voices will be muted before the All -beneficent, and you will hear \\nnothing but a murmur. (108) Intercession will not avail that day except from h im whom the All -\\nbeneficent allows and approves of his word. (109) He knows what is before them and behind them, \\nthough they do not comprehend Him in their knowledge. (110) All faces shall be humbled before the \\nLiving One, the All -sustainer, and those who b ear [the burden of] wrongdoing will fail. (111) But \\nwhoever does righteous deeds, being faithful, will neither fear any injustice or disparagement.

(113) So exalted is Allah, the True \\nSovereign. Do not hasten with the Quran before its revelation is completed for you, and say, ‘My Lord! \\nIncrease me in knowledge.’ (114) Certainly We had enjoined Adam earlier; but he forgot, and We did not \\nfind any resoluteness in him. (115) When We said to the angels, ‘Prostrate before Adam,’ they \\nprostrated, but not Iblis: he refused. (116) We said, ‘O Adam! This is indeed an enemy of yours and your \\nmate’s. So do not let him expel you from paradise, or you will be miserable. (117) You will neither be \\nhungry in it nor naked. (118) You will neither be thirsty in it, nor suffer from *the heat of+ the sun.’ (119) \\nThen Satan tempted him. He said, ‘O Adam! Shall I show you the tree of immortality, and an \\nimperishable kingdom?’ (120) So they both ate of it, and their nakedness became evident to them, and \\nthey began to stitch over themselves with the leaves of paradise. Adam disobeyed his Lord, and went \\namiss. (121) Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him clemently, and guided him. (122) He said, ‘Get \\ndown both of you from it, all together, being enemies of one another! Yet, should any guidance come to \\nyou from Me, those who follow My guidance will not go astray, no r will they be miserable.

(4) O people! If you are in doubt \\nabout the resurrection, [consider that] We created yo u from dust, then from a drop of [seminal] fluid, \\nthen from a clinging mass, then from a fleshy tissue, partly formed and partly unformed, so that We may \\nmanifest [Our power] to you. We lodge in the wombs whatever [fetus] We wish for a specified term, \\nthen We bring you forth as infants, then [We rear you] so that you may come of age.

That is manifest loss. (11) He invokes \\nbesides Allah that which can bring him neither benefit nor harm. That is extreme error.

And give good news to the virtuous. (37) Allah will ind eed defend those who have \\nfaith. Indeed Allah does not like any ingrate traitor. (38) Those who are fought against are permitted [to \\nfight] because they have been wronged, and Allah is indeed able to help them (39) —those who were \\nexpelled from their homes  unjustly, only because they said, ‘Allah is our Lord.’ Had not Allah repulsed \\nthe people from one another, ruin would have befallen the monasteries, churches, synagogues and \\nmosques in which Allah’s Name is much invoked. Allah will surely help those who help Him. Indeed Allah \\nis all-strong, all-mighty. (40) Those who, if We granted them power in the land, will maintain the prayer, \\ngive the zakat, bid what is right and forbid what is wrong. And with Allah rests the outcome of all \\nmatters. (41) If they impug n you, the people of Noah had impugned before them and ‘Ad and Thamud, \\n(42) [as well as] the people of Abraham and the people of Lot, (43) and the inhabitants of Midian, and \\nMoses was also impugned. But I gave the faithless a respite, then I seized them an d how was My \\nrebuttal! (44) How many towns We have destroyed when they had been wrongdoers! So they lie fallen \\non their trellises, their wells neglected and their ruined palaces! (45) Have they not travelled through \\nthe land so that they may have hearts by  which they may exercise their reason, or ears by which they \\nmay hear? Indeed, it is not the eyes that turn blind, but it is the hearts in the breasts that turn blind! (46) \\nThey ask you to hasten the punishment, though Allah will never break His promise. I ndeed a day with \\nyour Lord is like a thousand years by your reckoning. (47) To how many a town did I give respite while it \\nwas doing wrong! Then I seized it, and toward Me is the destination. (48) Say, ‘O mankind! I am only a \\nmanifest warner to you!’ (49) As for those who have faith and do righteous deeds, for them will be'),\n",

(54) Those who are faithless persist in their \\ndoubt about it, until either the Hour overtakes them suddenly, or they are overtaken by the punishment \\nof an inauspicious day. (55) On that day all sovereignty will belong to Allah: He will judge between them; \\nthen those who have faith and do righteous deeds will be in gardens of bliss, (56 ) and those who are \\nfaithless and deny Our signs —for such there will be a humiliating punishment. (57) Those who migrate \\nin the way of Allah and then are slain, or die, Allah will surely provide them with a good provision. Allah \\nis indeed the best of provi ders. (58) He will admit them into an abode they are pleased with. Indeed \\nAllah is all-knowing, all-forbearing. (59) So will it be; and whoever retaliates with the like of what he has \\nbeen made to suffer, and is aggressed against [again] thereafter, Allah will surely help him. Indeed Allah \\nis all-excusing, all-forgiving. (60) So will it be, because Allah makes the night pass into the day and makes \\nthe day pass into the night, and because Allah is all-hearing, all-seeing. (61) So will it be, because Allah is \\nthe Reality, and what they invoke besides Him is nullity, and because Allah is the All -exalted, the All -\\ngreat.

(63) To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and \\nwhatever is in the earth, Indeed Allah is the All -sufficient, the All -laudable. (64) Have you not regarded \\nthat Allah has disposed for you [r benefit] whatever there is in the earth, and [that] the ships s ail at sea \\nby His command, and He sustains the sky lest it should fall on the earth, excepting [when it does so] by \\nHis leave? Indeed Allah is most kind and merciful to mankind. (65) It is He who gave you life then He \\nmakes you die, then He brings you to l ife. Indeed man is very ungrateful. (66) For every nation We have \\nappointed rites [of worship] which they observe; so let them not dispute with you concerning your \\nreligion, and invite to your Lord. Indeed, you are on a straight guidance. (67) But if they dispute with \\nyou, say, ‘Allah knows best what you are doing. (68) Allah will judge between you on the Day of \\nResurrection concerning that about which you used to differ. (69) Do you not know that Allah knows \\nwhatever there is in the heaven and the earth? A ll that is in a Book. That is indeed easy for Allah.’ (70) \\nThey worship besides Allah that for which He has not sent down any authority, and of which they have \\nno knowledge. The wrongdoers will have no helper. (71) When Our manifest signs are recited to th em, \\nyou perceive denial on the faces of the faithless: they would almost pounce upon those who recite Our \\nsigns to them. Say, ‘Shall I inform you about something worse than that? The Fire which Allah has \\npromised the faithless, and it is an evil destinatio n.’ (72) O people! Listen to a parable that is being \\ndrawn: Indeed those whom you invoke besides Allah will never create [even] a fly even if they all rallied \\nto do so! And if a fly should take away something from them, they can not recover that from it. Feeble is \\nthe seeker and the sought! (73) They do not regard Allah with the regard due to Him. Indeed Allah is all -\\nstrong, all -mighty. (74) Allah chooses messengers from angels and from mankind. Indeed Allah is all -\\nhearing, all-seeing.

(9) It is they who will be the inheritors, (10) who shall inherit paradise and will remain in \\nit [forever]. (11) Certainly We created man from an extract of clay. (12) Then We made him a drop of \\n[seminal] fluid [lodged] in a secure abode. (13) Then We created th e drop of fluid as a clinging mass. \\nThen We created the clinging mass as a fleshy tissue. Then We created the fleshy tissue as bones. Then \\nWe clothed the bones with flesh. Then We produced him as [yet] another creature. So blessed is Allah, \\nthe best of cre ators! (14) Then indeed you die after that. (15) Then you will indeed be raised up on the \\nDay of Resurrection. (16) Certainly We created above you seven levels and We have not been oblivious \\nof the creation. (17) We sent down water from the sky in a measur ed manner, and We lodged it within \\nthe ground, and We are indeed able to take it away. (18) Then with it We produced for you gardens of \\ndate palms and vines. There are abundant fruits in them for you, and you eat from them, (19) and a tree \\nthat grows on Mount Sinai, which produces oil and a seasoning for those who eat. (20) There is indeed a \\nmoral for you in the cattle: We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, and you have many uses \\nin them, and you eat some of them, (21) and you are carried on them and on ships. (22) Certainly We \\nsent Noah to his people, and he said, ‘O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other god besides Him. \\nWill you not then be wary *of Him+?’ (23) But the elite of the faithless from among his people said, ‘This \\nis just a human being like you, who seeks to dominate you. Had Allah wished, He would have sent down \\nangels. We never heard of such a thing among our forefathers. (24) He is just a man possessed by \\nmadness. So bear with him for a while.’ (25) He said, ‘My Lord! H elp me, for they impugn me.’ (26) So \\nWe revealed to him: ‘Build the ark before Our eyes and by Our revelation. When Our edict comes and \\nthe oven gushes [a stream of water], bring into it a pair of every kind [of animal], and your family, except \\nthose of them against whom the decree has gone beforehand, and do not plead with Me for those who \\nare wrongdoers: they shall indeed be drowned.’ (27) ‘When you, and those who are with you, are \\nsettled in the ark, say, ‘‘All praise belongs to Allah, who has delivered us from the wrongdoing lot.’’ (28) \\nAnd say, ‘‘My Lord! Land me with a blessed landing, for You are the best of those who bring ashore.’’ ’ \\n(29) There are indeed signs in this; and indeed, We have been testing.

(46) They said, ‘Shall we \\nbelieve two humans like ourselves, while their people are our slaves?’ (47) So they impugned the two of \\nthem, whereat they were among those who were destroyed. (48) Certain ly We gave Moses the Book so \\nthat they might be guided, (49) and We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and sheltered \\nthem in a level highland with flowing water. (50) O apostles! Eat of the good things and act righteously. \\nIndeed I know best what you do. (51) Indeed this community of yours is one community, and I am your \\nLord, so be wary of Me.

(61) We task no soul except \\naccording to its capacity, and with Us is a book that speaks the truth, and they will not be wronged. (62) \\nIndeed, their hearts are in a stupor in regard to this, and there are other deeds besides which they \\nperpetrate.

(65) Certainly My \\nsigns used to be recited to you, but you used to take to your heels, (66) being disdainful of it, talking \\nnonsense in your nightly sessions.’ (67) Have they not contemplated the Discourse, or has anything \\ncome to them [in it] that did not come to their forefathers? (68) Is it that they do not recognize their \\napostle, and so  they deny him? (69) Do they say, ‘There is madness in him’? No, he has brought them \\nthe truth, and most of them are averse to the truth. (70) Had the truth followed their desires, the \\nheavens and the earth would have surely fallen apart [along] with those  who are in them. Indeed, We \\nhave brought them their Reminder, but they are disregardful of their Reminder. (71) Do you ask a \\nrecompense from them? Your Lord’s recompense is better, and He is the best of providers. (72) Indeed \\nyou invite them to a straight  path, (73) and those who do not believe in the Hereafter surely deviate \\nfrom the path. (74) Should We have mercy upon them and remove their distress, they would surely \\npersist, bewildered in their rebellion. (75) We have already seized them with punishmen t, yet they did \\nnot humble themselves before their Lord, nor will they entreat [Him for mercy] (76) until We open on \\nthem the gate of a severe punishment, whereupon they will be despondent in it.

(31) Marry off those who are single among \\nyou, and the upright among your male and female slaves. If they are poor, Allah will enrich them out of \\nHis grace, a nd Allah is all -bounteous, all -knowing. (32) Those who cannot afford marriage should be \\ncontinent until Allah enriches them out of His grace. As for those who seek an emancipation deal from \\namong your slaves, make such a deal with them if you know any good  in them, and give them out of the \\nwealth of Allah which He has given you. Do not compel your female slaves to prostitution when they \\ndesire to be chaste, seeking the transitory wares of the life of this world. Should anyone compel them, \\nAllah will be forg iving and merciful to them following their compulsion. (33) Certainly We have sent \\ndown to you manifest signs and a description of those who passed before you, and an advice for the \\nGodwary. (34) Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is a niche wherein \\nis a lamp —the lamp is in a glass, the glass as it were a glittering star —lit from a blessed olive tree, \\nneither eastern nor western, whose oil almost lights up, though fire should not touch it. Light upon light. \\nAllah guide s to His Light whomever He wishes. Allah draws parables for mankind, and Allah has \\nknowledge of all things. (35) In houses Allah has allowed to be raised and wherein His Name is \\ncelebrated; He is glorified therein, morning and evening, (36) by men whom nei ther trade nor \\nbargaining distracts from the remembrance of Allah and the maintenance of prayer and the giving of \\nzakat. They are fearful of a day wherein the hearts and the sights will be transformed, (37) so that Allah \\nmay reward them by the best of what  they have done, and enhance them out of His grace, and Allah \\nprovides for whomever He wishes without any reckoning. (38) As for the faithless, their works are like a \\nmirage in a plain, which the thirsty man supposes to be water. When he comes to it, he fi nds it to be \\nnothing; but there he finds Allah, who will pay him his full account, and Allah is swift at reckoning. (39) \\nOr like the manifold darkness in a deep sea, covered by billow upon billow, overcast by clouds; manifold \\n[layers of] darkness, one on t op of another: when he brings out his hand, he can hardly see it. One \\nwhom Allah has not granted any light has no light. (40) Have you not regarded that Allah is glorified by \\neveryone in the heavens and the earth, and the birds spreading their wings. Each knows his prayer and \\nglorification, and Allah knows best what they do. (41) To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and \\nthe earth, and toward Allah is the destination. (42) Have you not regarded that Allah drives the clouds, \\nthen He composes them, then He piles them up, whereat you see the rain issuing from its midst? And He \\nsends down hail from the sky, out of the mountains that are in it, and He strikes with it whomever He \\nwishes, and turns it away from whomever He wishes.

(46) They say, ‘We have faith \\nin Allah and His Apostle, and we obey.’ Then, after that, a part of them refuse to comply, and they do \\nnot have faith. (47) When they are summoned to Allah and His Apostle that He may judge between \\nthem, behold, a part of them tur n aside. (48) But if justice be on their side, they come compliantly to \\nhim. (49) Is there a sickness in their hearts? Do they have doubts, or fear that Allah and His Apostle will \\nbe unjust to them? Indeed, it is they who are the wrongdoers. (50) All the response of the faithful, when \\nthey are summoned to Allah and His Apostle that He may judge between them, is to say, ‘We hear and \\nobey.’ It is they who are the felicitous. (51) Whoever obeys Allah and His Apostle, and fears Allah and is \\nwary of Him—it is they who will be the triumphant. (52) They swear by Allah with solemn oaths that if \\nyou order them they will surely march out. Say, ‘Do not swear! Honourable obedience *is all that is \\nexpected of you+. Allah is indeed well aware of what you do.’ (53) Say, ‘O bey Allah, and obey the \\nApostle.’ But if you turn your backs, *you should know that+ he is only responsible for his burden and \\nyou are responsible for your own burden, and if you obey him, you will be guided, and the Apostle’s \\nduty is only to communicate i n clear terms. (54) Allah has promised those of you who have faith and do \\nrighteous deeds that He will surely make them successors in the earth, just as He made those who were \\nbefore them successors, and He will surely establish for them their religion whi ch He has approved for \\nthem, and that He will surely change their state to security after their fear, while they worship Me, not \\nascribing any partners to Me. Whoever is ungrateful after that—it is they who are the transgressors. (55) \\nMaintain the prayer a nd give the zakat, and obey the Apostle so that you may receive *Allah’s+ mercy. \\n(56) Do not suppose that those who are faithless can frustrate [Allah] on the earth. Their refuge shall be \\nthe Fire, and it is surely an evil destination. (57) O you who have faith! Your slaves and any of you who \\nhave not yet reached puberty should seek your permission three times: before the dawn prayer, and \\nwhen you put off your garments at noon, and after the night prayer. These are three times of privacy for \\nyou. Apart from  these, it is not sinful of you or them to frequent one another [freely]. Thus does Allah \\nclarify the signs for you, and Allah is all -knowing, all-wise. (58) When your children reach puberty, let \\nthem ask permission [at all times] just as those [who grew up] before them asked permission. Thus does \\nAllah clarify His signs for you, and Allah is all -knowing, all-wise. (59) As for women advanced in years \\nwho do not expect to marry, there will be no sin upon them if they put off their cloaks, without \\ndisplaying their adornment. But it is better for them to be modest, and Allah is all -hearing, all-knowing. \\n(60) There is no blame upon the blind, nor any blame upon the lame, nor any blame upon the sick, nor \\nupon yourselves if you eat from your own houses, or your fa thers’ houses, or your mothers’ houses, or \\nyour brothers’ houses, or your sisters’ houses, or the houses of your paternal uncles, or the houses of \\nyour paternal aunts, or the houses of your maternal uncles, or the houses of your maternal aunts, or \\nthose wh ose keys are in your possession, or those of your friends. There will be no blame on you \\nwhether you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses, greet yourselves with a salutation \\nfrom Allah, blessed and good. Thus does Allah clarify His signs fo r you so that you may exercise your \\nreason. (61) Indeed the faithful are those who have faith in Allah and His Apostle, and when they are \\nwith him in a collective affair, they do not leave until they have sought his permission.

(2) Yet they have taken gods besides Him who create nothing and have themselves been \\ncreated, and who have no control over their own harm or benefit and have no control over [their own] \\ndeath, life, or resurrection. (3) The faithless say, ‘This is nothing but a li e that he has fabricated, and \\nother people have abetted him in it.’ Thus they have certainly come out with wrongdoing and falsehood. \\n(4) They say, ‘He has taken down myths of the ancients, and they are dictated to him morning and \\nevening.’ (5) Say, ‘It has  been sent down by Him who knows the hidden in the heavens and the earth. \\nIndeed He is all-forgiving, all-merciful.’ (6) And they say, ‘What sort of apostle is this who eats food and \\nwalks in the marketplaces? Why has not an angel been sent down to him so as to be a warner along with \\nhim?’ (7) Or, ‘*Why is not+ a treasure thrown to him, or *why does+ he *not+ have a garden from which he \\nmay eat?’ And the wrongdoers say, ‘You are just following a bewitched man.’ (8) Look, how they coin \\nepithets for you; so t hey go astray, and cannot find the way. (9) Blessed is He who will grant you better \\nthan that if He wishes —gardens with streams running in them, and He will make for you palaces.

(13) [They will \\nbe told:+ ‘Do not pray for a single annihilation today, but pray for many annihilations!’ (14) Say, ‘Is that \\nbetter, or the everlasting paradise promised to the Godwary, which will be their reward and \\ndestination?’ (15) There they will have whatever they wish, abiding [forever]—a promise [much] \\nbesought, [binding] on your Lord. (16) On the day that He will muster them and those whom they \\nworship besides Allah, He will say, ‘Was it you who led astray these servants of Mine, or did they \\nthemselves stray from the way?’ (17) They will say, ‘Immaculate are You! It does not behoove us to take \\nany wali in Your stead! But You provided for them and their fathers until they forgot the Reminder, and \\nthey were a ruined lot.’ (18) So they will certainly impugn you in what you say, an d you will neither be \\nable to circumvent [punishment] nor find help, and whoever of you does wrong, We shall make him \\ntaste a terrible punishment.

(76) They are i ndeed \\nenemies to me, but the Lord of all the worlds, (77) who created me, it is He who guides me, (78) and \\nprovides me with food and drink, (79) and when I get sick, it is He who cures me; (80) who will make me \\ndie, then He will bring me to life, (81) and who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the Day of \\nRetribution.’ (82) ‘My Lord! Grant me *unerring+ judgement, and unite me with the Righteous. (83) \\nConfer on me a worthy repute among the posterity, (84) and make me one of the heirs to the paradise \\nof bliss. (85) Forgive my father, for he is one of those who are astray. (86) Do not disgrace me on the day \\nthat they will be resurrected, (87) the day when neither wealth nor children will avail, (88) except him \\nwho comes to Allah with a sound heart,’ (89) and  paradise will be brought near for the Godwary, (90) \\nand hell will be brought into view for the perverse, (91) and they shall be told: ‘Where is that which you \\nused to worship (92) besides Allah? Do they help you, or do they help each other?’ (93) Then they will be \\ncast into it on their faces —they and the perverse, (94) and the hosts of Iblis all together. (95) They will \\nsay, as they wrangle in it *together+, (96) ‘By Allah, we had indeed been in manifest error (97) when we \\nequated you with the Lord of all the worlds! (98) No one led us astray except the guilty. (99) Now we \\nhave no intercessors, (100) nor do we have any sympathetic friend.

(4) They are the ones for whom there is a terrible punishment, and they are \\nthe ones who will be the biggest losers in the Hereafter. (5) Indeed you receive the Quran from One who \\nis all-wise, all-knowing. (6) When Moses said to his family, ‘Indeed I descry a fire! I will bring you some \\nnews from it, or bring you a firebrand so that you may warm yourselves.’ (7) When he came to it, he was \\ncalled: ‘Blessed is He who is in the fire an d who is [as well] around it, and immaculate is Allah, the Lord \\nof all the worlds!’ (8) ‘O Moses!

So observe how the fate of the \\nagents of corruption was! (14) Certainly, We gave knowledge to David and Solomon, and they said, ‘All \\npraise belongs to Allah,  who granted us an advantage over many of His faithful servants.’ (15) Solomon \\ninherited from David, and he said, ‘O people! We have been taught the speech of the birds, and we have \\nbeen given out of everything. Indeed this is a manifest advantage.’ (16) * Once+ Solomon’s hosts were \\nmarched out for him, comprising jinn, humans and birds, and they were held in check. (17) When they \\ncame to the Valley of Ants, an ant said, ‘O ants! Enter your dwellings, lest Solomon and his hosts should \\ntrample on you while they are unaware.’ (18) Whereat he smiled, amused at its words, and he said, ‘My \\nLord! Inspire me to give thanks for Your blessing with which You have blessed me and my parents, and \\nthat I may do righteous deeds which please You, and admit me, by Your mercy,  among Your righteous \\nservants.’ (19) *One day+ he reviewed the birds, and said, ‘Why do I not see the hoopoe? Or is he \\nabsent?’ (20) ‘I will punish him with a severe punishment, or I will behead him, unless he brings me a \\ncredible excuse.’ (21) He did not  stay for long *before he turned up+ and said, ‘I have alighted on \\nsomething which you have not alighted on, and I have brought you from Sheba a definite report. (22) I \\nfound a woman ruling over them, and she has been given everything, and she has a great throne. (23) I \\nfound her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah, and Satan has made their deeds seem \\ndecorous to them —thus he has barred them from the way [of Allah], so they are not guided — (24) so \\nthat they do not prostrate themselves to Allah, who brings forth the hidden in the heavens and the \\nearth, and He knows whatever you hide and whatever you disclose.

Whoever gives thanks, gives thanks only for his own sake. And whoever is ungrateful [should \\nknow that] my Lord is indeed all-sufficient, all-generous.’ (40) He said, ‘Disguise her throne for her, so \\nthat we may see whether she is discerning or if she is one of the undiscerning ones.’ (41) So when she \\ncame, it was said *to her+, ‘Is your throne like this one?’ She said , ‘It seems to be the same, and we were \\ninformed before it, and we had submitted.’ (42) She had been barred *from the way of Allah+ by what \\nshe used to worship besides Allah, for she belonged to a faithless people. (43) It was said to her, ‘Enter \\nthe palace.’ So when she saw it, she supposed it to be a pool of water, and she bared her shanks. He \\nsaid, ‘It is a palace paved with crystal.’ She said, ‘My Lord! Indeed I have wronged myself, and I submit \\nwith Solomon to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.’ (44) Certainly We sent to Thamud Salih, their brother, \\n*with the summons:+ ‘Worship Allah!’ But thereat they became two groups contending with each other. \\n(45) He said, ‘O My people! Why do you press for evil sooner than for good? Why do you not plead to \\nAllah for forgiveness so that you may receive His mercy?’ (46) They said, ‘We take you and those who \\nare with you for a bad omen.’ He said, ‘Your bad omens are from Allah. Indeed, you are a people being \\ntested.’ (47) There were nine persons in the city who caused  corruption in the land and did not set \\nthings right. (48) They said, ‘Swear by Allah that we will attack him and his family by night. Then we will \\ntell his heir that we were not present at the murder of his family and that we speak the truth.’ (49) They \\ndevised a plot, and We [too] devised a plan, but they were not aware. (50) So observe how was the \\noutcome of their plotting, as We destroyed them and all their people. (51) So there lay their houses, \\nfallen in ruin because of their wrongdoing. There is inde ed a sign in that for a people who have \\nknowledge. (52) And We delivered those who had faith and were Godwary. (53) [We also sent] Lot, \\nwhen he said to his people, ‘What! Do you commit this indecency while you look on? (54) Do you \\napproach men with [sexual + desire instead of women?! Indeed, you are a senseless lot!’ (55) But the \\nonly answer of his people was that they said, ‘Expel Lot’s family from your town! They are indeed a \\npuritanical lot.’ (56) So We delivered him and his family, except his wife. We or dained her to be among \\nthose who remained behind. (57) Then We poured down upon them a rain [of stones]. Evil was that rain \\nfor those who had been warned!

(6) We revealed to Moses’ mother, *saying+, ‘Nurse him; then, when you fear \\nfor him, cast him into the river, and do not fear or grieve, for We will restore him to you and make him \\none of the apostles.’ (7) Then Pharaoh’s kinsmen picked him up that he might be an enemy and a cause \\nof grief to them. Indeed Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were iniquitous. (8) Pharaoh’s wife said *to \\nhim+, ‘*This infant will be] a [source of] comfort to me and to you. Do not kill him. Maybe he will benefit \\nus, or we will adopt him as a son.’ But they were not aware. (9) The heart of Moses’ mother became \\ndesolate, and indeed she was about to divulge it had We not fortifie d her heart so that she might have \\nfaith *in Allah’s promise+. (10) She said to his sister, ‘Follow him.’ So she watched him from a distance, \\nwhile they were not aware. (11) Since before We had forbidden him to be suckled by any nurse. So she \\nsaid, ‘Shall I show you a household that will take care of him for you and they will be his well -wishers?’ \\n(12) That is how We restored him to his mother so that she might be comforted and not grieve, and that \\nshe might know that Allah’s promise is true, but most of th em do not know. (13) When he came of age \\nand became fully matured, We gave him judgement and knowledge, and thus do We reward the \\nvirtuous. (14) [One day] he entered the city at a time when its people were not likely to take notice. He \\nfound there two men fighting, this one from among his followers, and that one from his enemies. The \\none who was from his followers sought his help against him who was from his enemies. So Moses hit \\nhim with his fist, whereupon he expired. He said, ‘This is of Satan’s doing. I ndeed he is clearly a \\nmisguiding enemy.’ (15) He said, ‘My Lord! I have wronged myself. Forgive me!’ So He forgave him. \\nIndeed, He is the All -forgiving, the All -merciful. (16) He said, ‘My Lord! As You have blessed me, I will \\nnever be a supporter of the gu ilty.’ (17) He rose at dawn in the city, fearful and vigilant, when behold, \\nthe one who had sought his help the day before, shouted for his help [once again]. Moses said to him, \\n‘You are indeed clearly perverse!’ (18) But when he wanted to strike him who w as an enemy of both of \\nthem, he said, ‘Moses, do you want to kill me, just like the one you killed yesterday? You only want to be \\na tyrant in the land, and you do not desire to be one who brings about reform.’ (19) There came a man \\nfrom the city outskirts,  hurrying. He said, ‘Moses! The elite are indeed conspiring to kill you. So leave. I \\nam indeed your well -wisher.’ (20) So he left the city, fearful and vigilant. He said, ‘My Lord! Deliver me \\nfrom the wrongdoing lot.’ (21) And when he turned his face toward Midian, he said, ‘Maybe my Lord will \\nshow me the right way.’ (22) When he arrived at the well of Midian, he found there a throng of people \\nwatering [their flocks], and he found, besides them, two women holding back [their flock]. He said, \\n‘What is your b usiness?’ They said, ‘We do not water *our flock+ until the shepherds have driven out \\n*their flocks+, and our father is an aged man.’ (23) So he watered *their flock+ for them. Then he \\nwithdrew toward the shade and said, ‘My Lord! I am indeed in need of an y good You may send down to \\nme!’ (24) Then one of the two women approached him, walking bashfully. She said, ‘Indeed my father \\ninvites you to pay you the wages for watering *our flock+ for us.’ So when he came to him and recounted \\nthe story to him, he said, ‘Do not be afraid. You have been delivered from the wrongdoing lot.’ (25) One'),\n",

Indeed the best you can hire is a powerful and trustworthy \\nman.’ (26) He said, ‘Indeed I desire to marry you to one of these two daugh ters of mine, on condition \\nthat you hire yourself to me for eight years. And if you complete ten, that will be up to you, and I do not \\nwant to be hard on you. God willing, you will find me to a righteous person.’ (27) He said, ‘This will be \\n[by consent] between you and me. Whichever of the two terms I complete, there shall be no imposition \\nupon me, and Allah is witness over what we say.’ (28) So when Moses completed the term and set out \\nwith his family, he descried a fire on the side of the mountain. He sai d to his family, ‘Wait! Indeed, I \\ndescry a fire! Maybe I will bring you some news from it, or a brand of fire so that you may warm \\nyourselves.’ (29) When he approached it, he was called from the right bank of the valley in that blessed \\nsite from the tree: ‘Moses! Indeed I am Allah, the Lord of all the worlds!’ (30) And: ‘Throw down your \\nstaff!’ And when he saw it wriggling as if it were a snake, he turned his back *to flee+, without looking \\nback. ‘Moses! Come forward, and do not be afraid. Indeed you are safe.’ (31) ‘Insert your hand into your \\nshirt. It will emerge white, without any fault, and keep your arms drawn in awe to your sides. These shall \\nbe two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his elite. They are indeed a transgressing lot.’ (32) He said, \\n‘My Lord!

With the help of Our signs, you two, and those \\nwho follow the two of you, shall be the victors.’ (35) When Moses brought them Our manifest signs, \\nthey said, ‘This is nothing but concocted magic. We never heard of such a thing among our forefathers.’ \\n(36) Moses said, ‘My Lord knows best who brings guidance from Him, and in whose favour the outcome \\nof that abode will be. The wrongdoers will not be felic itous.’ (37) Pharaoh said, ‘O *members of the+ \\nelite! I do not know of any god that you may have besides me. Haman, light for me a fire over clay, and \\nbuild me a tower so that I may take a look at Moses’ god, and indeed I consider him to be a liar!’ (38) H e \\nand his hosts unduly acted arrogantly in the land, and thought they would not be brought back to Us. \\n(39) So We seized him and his hosts, and threw them into the sea. So observe how was the fate of the \\nwrongdoers! (40) We made them leaders who invite to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will \\nnot receive any help. (41) We made a curse pursue them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection \\nthey will be among the disfigured. (42) Certainly We gave Moses the Book, after We had destroyed the \\nformer generations, as [a set of] eye -openers, guidance and mercy for mankind, so that they may take \\nadmonition. (43) You were not on the western side when We revealed the commandments to Moses, \\nnor were you among the witnesses. (44) But We brought forth othe r generations and time took its toll \\non them. You did not dwell among the people of Midian reciting to them Our signs, but it is We who are \\nthe senders [of the apostles].

Indeed we \\nwere Muslims *even+ before it *came+.’ (53) Those will be given their reward two times for their \\npatience.

But most of them do not \\nknow. (57) How many a town We have destr oyed that exulted in its lifestyle! There lie their dwellings, \\nuninhabited after them except by a few, and We were the [sole] inheritors. (58) Your Lord would not \\ndestroy the towns until He had raised an apostle in their mother city to recite to them Our s igns. We \\nwould never destroy the towns except when their people were wrongdoers. (59) Whatever things you \\nhave been given are only the wares of the life of this world and its glitter, and what is with Allah is better \\nand more lasting. Will you not exercise your reason? (60) Is he to whom We have given a good promise, \\nwhich he will receive, like him whom We have provided the wares of the life of this world, but who will \\nbe arraigned on the Day of Resurrection? (61) The day He will call out to them and ask, ‘ Where are My \\n‘partners’ that you used to claim?’ (62) Those against whom the word had become due will say, ‘Our \\nLord! These are the ones whom we have perverted. We perverted them as we were perverse ourselves. \\nWe repudiate them before You: it was not us th at they worshipped.’ (63) It will be said, ‘Invoke your \\npartners!’ So they will invoke them, but they will not respond to them, and they will sight the \\npunishment, wishing they had followed guidance. (64) The day He will call out to them and say, ‘What \\nresponse did you give to the apostles?’ (65) That day all information will be withheld from them, so they \\nwill not question one another. (66) As for him who repents, has faith and acts righteously, maybe he will \\nbe among the felicitous. (67) Your Lord creates  whatever He wishes and chooses: they have no choice. \\nImmaculate is Allah and exalted above [having] any partners that they ascribe [to Him]. (68) Your Lord \\nknows whatever their breasts conceal, and whatever they disclose. (69) He is Allah, there is no god  \\nexcept Him. All praise belongs to Him in this world and the Hereafter. All judgement belongs to Him, and \\nto Him you will be brought back. (70) Say, ‘Tell me, if Allah were to make the night perpetual for you \\nuntil the Day of Resurrection, what god other t han Allah can bring you light? Will you not listen?’ (71) \\nSay, ‘Tell me, if Allah were to make the day perpetual for you until the Day of Resurrection, what god \\nother than Allah can bring you night wherein you can rest? Will you not perceive?’ (72) He has made for \\nyou the night and the day out of His mercy, so that you may rest therein and that you may seek His \\nbounty and so that you may give thanks. (73) The day He will call out to them and say, ‘Where are My \\n‘partners’ that you used to claim?’ (74) We sha ll draw from every nation a witness and say, ‘Produce \\nyour evidence.’ Then they will know that all reality belongs to Allah and what they used to fabricate will \\nforsake them.

(5) Whoever strives, strives only for his own sake. Indeed Allah has no need \\nof the creatures. (6) As for those who have faith and do righteous deeds, We will absolve them of their \\nmisdeeds and We will surely reward them by the best  of what they used to do. (7) We have enjoined \\nman to be good to his parents. But if they urge you to ascribe to Me as partner that of which you have \\nno knowledge, then do not obey them. To Me will be your return, whereat I will inform you concerning \\nwhat you used to do. (8) Those who have faith and do righteous deeds, We will surely admit them \\namong the righteous.

(12) But they will carry their own bur dens and other burdens along with their own burdens, and \\nthey will surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning that which they used to fabricate. \\n(13) Certainly We sent Noah to his people, and he remained with them for a thousand -less-fifty years. \\nThen the flood overtook them while they were wrongdoers. (14) Then We delivered him and those who \\nwere in the Ark, and made it a sign for all the nations. (15) And Abraham, when he said to his people, \\n‘Worship Allah and be wary of Him. That is bette r for you, should you know. (16) What you worship \\ninstead of Allah are mere idols, and you invent a lie. Indeed those whom you worship besides Allah have \\nno control over your provision. So seek all [your] provision from Allah, and worship Him and thank Him , \\nand to Him you shall be brought back.’ (17) If you impugn *the Apostle’s teaching+, then *other+ nations \\nhave impugned *likewise+ before you, and the Apostle’s duty is only to communicate in clear terms. (18) \\nHave they not regarded how Allah originates the creation? Then He will bring it back. That is indeed easy \\nfor Allah.

(6) They know just an outward aspect of the life of the world, but they are oblivious \\nof the Hereafter. (7) Have they not reflected in their own souls? Allah did not create the heavens and \\nthe earth and whatever is between them except with consummat e wisdom and for a specified term. \\nIndeed many people disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord. (8) Have they not travelled in the land \\nand seen how was the fate of those who were before them? They were more powerful than them, and \\nthey plowed the earth and developed it more than they have developed it. Their apostles brought them \\nmanifest proofs. So it was not Allah who wronged them, but it was they who used to wrong themselves. \\n(9) Then the fate of those who committed misdeeds was that they denied the signs of Allah and they \\nused to deride them. (10) Allah originates the creation, then He will bring it back, then you will be \\nbrought back to Him. (11) And when the Hour sets in, the guilty will despair. (12) None of those whom \\nthey ascribed as partners [t o Allah] will intercede for them, and they will disavow their partners. (13) \\nThe day the Hour sets in, they will be divided on that day [in separate groups]: (14) As for those who \\nhave faith and do righteous deeds, they shall be in a garden, rejoicing. (15 ) But as for those who were \\nfaithless and denied Our signs and the encounter of the Hereafter, they will be brought to the \\npunishment. (16) So glorify Allah when you enter evening and when you rise at dawn. (17) To Him \\nbelongs all praise in the heavens and the earth, at nightfall and when you enter noontime. (18) He brings \\nforth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living, and revives the earth after its \\ndeath. Likewise, you [too] shall be raised [from the dead]. (19) Of His signs is  that He created you from \\ndust, then, behold, you are humans scattering [all over]! (20) And of His signs is that He created for you \\nmates from your own selves that you may take comfort in them, and He ordained affection and mercy \\nbetween you. There are in deed signs in that for a people who reflect. (21) Among His signs is the \\ncreation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your languages and colours. There are \\nindeed signs in that for those who know. (22) And of His signs is your sleep by nigh t and day, and your \\npursuit of His bounty. There are indeed signs in that for a people who listen. (23) And of His signs is that \\nHe shows you the lightning, arousing fear and hope, and He sends down water from the sky, and with it \\nrevives the earth after i ts death. There are indeed signs in that for people who exercise their reason. \\n(24) And of His signs is that the sky and the earth stand by His command, and then, when He calls you \\nforth from the earth, behold, you will come forth.

His is the loftiest description in the heavens and the earth, and \\nHe is the All -mighty, the All -wise. (27) He draws for you an example from yourselves: Do you have \\namong your slaves any partners [who may share] in what We have provided you, so that you are equal \\nin its respect, and you revere them as you revere one another? Thus do We elabor ate the signs for \\npeople who exercise their reason. (28) Indeed, the wrongdoers follow their own desires without any \\nknowledge. So who will guide those whom Allah has led astray? They will have no helpers.

You can make only those hear who have \\nfaith in Our signs and have submitted. (53) It is Allah who created you from [a state of]  weakness, then \\nHe gave you power after weakness. Then, after power, He ordained weakness and old age: He creates \\nwhatever He wishes, and He is the All-knowing, the All-powerful. (54) On the day when the Hour sets in, \\nthe guilty will swear that they had remained only for an hour. That is how they were used to lying [in the \\nworld+.

Excepting \\nwhat your hearts may intend deliberately, there will be no sin upon you for any mistake that you may \\nmake therein. And Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful.

The blood relatives are more entitled to inherit from one \\nanother in the Book of Allah than the [other] faithful and Emigrants, barring any favour you may do your \\ncomrades.

And He has \\nprepared for the faithless a painful punishment. (8) O you who have faith!

(11) When the \\nhypocrites, as well as those in whose hearts is a sickness, were saying, ‘Allah and His Apostle did not \\npromise us *anything+ except delusion.’ (12) And when a group of them said, ‘O people of  Yathrib! [This \\nis+ not a place for you, so go back!’ A group of them sought the Prophet’s permission *to leave the scene \\nof battle+, saying, ‘Our homes lie exposed *to the enemy+,’ although they were not exposed. They only \\nsought to flee. (13) Had they be en invaded from its flanks and had they been asked to apostatize, they \\nwould have done so with only a mild hesitation, (14) though they had already pledged to Allah before \\nthat they would not turn their backs [to flee], and pledges given to Allah are accou ntable. (15) Say, \\n‘Flight will not avail you, if you flee from death, or from being killed, and then you will be let to enjoy \\nonly for a little while.’ (16) Say, ‘Who is it that can protect you from Allah if He desires to cause you \\nharm or desires to grant you His mercy?’ Besides Allah they will not find for themselves any protector or \\nhelper.

(25) And He dragged down from their \\nstrongholds those who had backed them from among the People of the Book, and He cast terror into \\ntheir hearts, [so that] you killed a part of them, and took captive [another] part. (26) He bequeathed you \\ntheir land, their houses and their possessions, and a territory you had not trodden, and Allah has po wer \\nover all things. (27) O Prophet! Say to your wives, ‘If you desire the life of the world and its glitter, come, \\nI will provide for you and release you in a graceful manner. (28) But if you desire Allah and His Apostle \\nand the abode of the Hereafter, th en Allah has indeed prepared a great reward for the virtuous among \\nyou.’ (29) O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you commits a gross indecency, her punishment shall be \\ndoubled, and that is easy for Allah. (30) But whoever of you is obedient to Allah and His Apostle and acts \\nrighteously, We shall give her a twofold reward, and We will have in store for her a noble provision. (31) \\nO wives of the Prophet! You are not like other women: if you are wary [of Allah], do not be complaisant \\nin your speech, lest he in  whose heart is a sickness should aspire; speak honourable words. (32) Stay in \\nyour houses and do not flaunt your finery like the former [days of pagan] ignorance. Maintain the prayer \\nand pay the zakat, and obey Allah and His Apostle. Indeed Allah desires to repel all impurity from you, O \\nPeople of the Household, and purify you with a thorough purification. (33) And remember what is \\nrecited in your homes of the signs of Allah and wisdom. Indeed Allah is all -attentive, all -aware. (34) \\nIndeed the muslim men and the muslim women, the faithful men and the faithful women, the obedient \\nmen and the obedient women, the truthful men and the truthful women, the patient men and the \\npatient women, the humble men and the humble women, the charitable men and the charitabl e \\nwomen, the men who fast and the women who fast, the men who guard their private parts and the \\nwomen who guard, the men who remember Allah greatly and the women who remember [Allah \\ngreatly]—Allah holds in store for them forgiveness and a great reward. (35 ) A faithful man or woman \\nmay not have any option in their matter, when Allah and His Apostle have decided on a matter, and \\nwhoever disobeys Allah and His Apostle has certainly strayed into manifest error. (36) When you said to \\nhim whom Allah had blessed, and whom you *too+ had blessed, ‘Retain your wife for yourself, and be \\nwary of Allah,’ and you had hidden in your heart what Allah was to divulge, and you feared the people \\nthough Allah is worthier that you should fear Him, so when Zayd had got through wit h her, We wedded \\nher to you, so that there may be no blame on the faithful in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, \\nwhen the latter have got through with them, and Allah’s command is bound to be fulfilled. (37) There is \\nno blame on the Prophet in res pect of that which Allah has made lawful for him: Allah’s precedent with \\nthose who passed away earlier (and Allah’s commands are ordained by a precise ordaining), (38) such as \\ndeliver the messages of Allah and fear Him, and fear no one except Allah, and Al lah suffices as reckoner. \\n(39) Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Apostle of Allah and the Seal of \\nthe Prophets, and Allah has knowledge of all things. (40) O you who have faith! Remember Allah with \\nfrequent remembrance, (41) and glorify Him morning and evening. (42) It is He who blesses you—and so \\ndo His angels —that He may bring you out from darkness into light, and He is most merciful to the \\nfaithful. (43) The day they encounter Him, their greeting will be, ‘Peace,’ and He hold s in store for them \\na noble reward. (44) O Prophet! Indeed We have sent you as a witness, as a bearer of good news and as \\na warner (45) and as a summoner to Allah by His permission, and as a radiant lamp. (46) Announce to \\nthe faithful the good news that th ere will be for them a great grace from Allah. (47) Do not obey the \\nfaithless and the hypocrites, and disregard their torments, and put your trust in Allah, and Allah suffices'),\n",

But provide for them and release them in a \\ngraceful manner. (49) O Prophet! Indeed We have made lawful to you your wives whom you have given \\ntheir dowries, and those whom your ri ght hand owns, of those whom Allah gave you as spoils of war, \\nand the daughters of your paternal uncle, and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters \\nof your maternal uncle, and the daughters of your maternal aunts who migrated with you, and a faithful \\nwoman if she offers herself to the Prophet and the Prophet desires to take her in marriage (a privilege \\nexclusively for you, not for [the rest of] the faithful; We know what We have made lawful for them with \\nrespect to their wives and those whom  their right hands own, so that there may be no blame on you ), \\nand Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful. (50) You may put off whichever of them you wish and consort with \\nwhichever of them you wish, and there is no sin upon you [in receiving again] any [of  them] whom you \\nmay seek [to consort with] from among those you have set aside [earlier]. That makes it likelier that \\nthey will be comforted and not feel unhappy, and all of them will be pleased with what you give them. \\nAllah knows what is in your hearts, and Allah is all-knowing, all-forbearing. (51) Beyond that, women are \\nnot lawful for you, nor that you should change them for other wives even though their beauty should \\nimpress you, except those whom your right hand owns. Allah is watchful over all things . (52) O you who \\nhave faith! Do not enter the Prophet’s houses for a meal until you are granted permission, without \\nhanging around for it to be readied. But enter when you are invited, and disperse when you have taken \\nyour meal, without cozying up for chat s. Such conduct on your part offends the Prophet, and he is \\nashamed of [asking] you [to leave]; but Allah is not ashamed of [expressing] the truth. When you ask \\n[his] womenfolk for something, do so from behind a curtain. That is more chaste for your hearts  and \\ntheirs. You should not offend the Apostle of Allah, nor may you ever marry his wives after him. Indeed \\nthat would be a grave [sin] with Allah. (53) Whether you disclose anything or hide it, Allah indeed knows \\nall things. (54) There is no sin on them [ in socializing freely] with their fathers, or their sons, or their \\nbrothers, or their brothers’ sons, or the sons of their sisters, or their own womenfolk, or what their right \\nhands own. Be wary of Allah. Indeed Allah is witness to all things. (55) Indeed Allah and His angels bless \\nthe Prophet; O you who have faith! Invoke blessings on him and invoke Peace upon him in a worthy \\nmanner. (56) Indeed those who offend Allah and His Apostle are cursed by Allah in the world and the \\nHereafter, and He has prepared a humiliating punishment for them. (57) Those who offend faithful men \\nand women undeservedly, certainly bear the guilt of slander and flagrant sin. (58) O Prophet! Tell your \\nwives and your daughters and the women of the faithful to draw closely over themsel ves their chadors \\n[when going out]. That makes it likely for them to be recognized and not be troubled, and Allah is all -\\nforgiving, all -merciful. (59) If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a sickness, and the \\nrumourmongers in the city do not desis t, We will prompt you [to take action] against them; then they \\nwill not be your neighbours in it except briefly. (60) Accursed, they will be seized wherever they are \\nconfronted and slain violently: (61) Allah’s precedent with those who passed away before, and you will \\nnever find any change in Allah’s precedent. (62) The people question you concerning the Hour. Say, ‘Its \\nknowledge is only with Allah.’ What do you know, maybe the Hour is near. (63) Indeed Allah has cursed \\nthe faithless and prepared for them a  blaze, (64) in which they will remain forever, and will not find any \\nguardian or helper. (65) The day when their faces are turned about in the Fire, they will say, ‘We wish \\nwe had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Apostle!’ (66) They will say, ‘Our Lord! We obe yed our leaders and \\nelders, and they led us astray from the way.’ (67) Our Lord! Give them a double punishment and curse \\nthem with a mighty curse.’ (68) O you who have faith!

(7) Has he fabricated a lie against Allah, or is there a madness in him?’ \\nIndeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter languish in punishment and extreme error. (8) Have \\nthey not regarded that which is before them and that which is behind them of the sky and the earth? If \\nWe like, We can make the earth swallow them, or let a fragment from the sky fall on them. There is \\nindeed a sign in that for every penitent servant. (9) Certainly We gave Dav id our grace: ‘O mountains \\nand birds, chime in with him!’ And We made iron soft for him, (10) saying, ‘Make easy coats of mail, and \\nkeep the measure in arranging *the links+, and act righteously. Indeed I watch what you do.’ (11) And for \\nSolomon [We subjected+ the wind: its morning course was a month’s journey and its evening course was \\na month’s journey. We made a fount of *molten+ copper flow for him, and *We placed at his service+ \\nsome of the jinn who would work for him by the permission of his Lord, and if any of them swerved from \\nOur command, We would make him taste the punishment of the Blaze. (12) They built for him as many \\ntemples as he wished, and figures, basins like cisterns, and caldrons fixed *in the ground+. ‘O House of \\nDavid, act thankfully, a nd few of My servants are grateful.’ (13) When We decreed death for him, \\nnothing apprised them of his death except a worm which gnawed away at his staff. And when he fell \\ndown, [the humans] realized that had the jinn known the Unseen, they would not have r emained in a \\nhumiliating torment. (14) There was certainly a sign for Sheba in their habitation: two gardens, to the \\nright and to the left. ‘Eat of the provision of your Lord and give Him thanks: a good land and an all -\\nforgiving Lord!’ (15) But they disreg arded [the path of Allah], so We unleashed upon them a violent \\nflood and replaced their two gardens with two gardens bearing bitter fruit, tamarisk, and sparse lote \\ntrees. (16) We requited them with that for their ingratitude. Do We not requite ingrates? ( 17) We had \\nplaced between them and the towns which We had blessed hamlets prominent [from the main route], \\nand We had ordained the course through them: ‘Travel through them in safety, night and day.’ (18) But \\nthey said, ‘Our Lord!

In it we are untouched by toil, and untouched by fatigue.’ (35) As for the \\nfaithless, there is for them the fire of hell: they will neither be done away with so that they may die, nor \\nshall its punishment be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every ingrate. (36) They shall cry therein \\nfor help: ‘Our Lord! Bring us out, so that we may act righteously —differently from what we used to do!’ \\n‘Did We not give you a lifelong enough that one who is heedful might take admo nition? And [moreover] \\nthe warner had [also] come to you. Now taste [the consequence of your deeds], for the wrongdoers \\nhave no helper.’ (37) Indeed Allah is the knower of the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He \\nknows well what is in the breast s. (38) It is He who made you successors on the earth. So whoever is \\nfaithless, his unfaith is to his own detriment. The unfaith of the faithless does not increase them with \\ntheir Lord [in anything] except disfavour, and their unfaith increases the faithle ss in nothing except loss. \\n(39) Say, ‘Tell me about your ‘partners’ whom you invoke besides Allah? Show me what *part+ of the \\nearth have they created. Have they any share in the heavens?’ Have We given them a scripture so that \\nthey stand on a manifest proo f from it? No, the wrongdoers do not promise one another [anything] \\nexcept delusion. (40) Indeed Allah sustains the heavens and the earth lest they should fall apart, and if \\nthey were to fall apart, there is none who can sustain them except Him. Indeed He is all-forbearing, all-\\nforgiving. (41) They had sworn by Allah with solemn oaths that if a warner were to come to them, they \\nwould be better guided than any of the nations. But when a warner came to them, it only increased \\ntheir distance [from the truth], (42) due to their domineering [conduct] in the land and their devising of \\nevil schemes; and evil schemes beset only their authors. So do they await anything except the precedent \\nof the ancients? Yet you will never find any change in Allah’s precedent, and you will never find any \\nrevision in Allah’s precedent. (43) Have they not travelled over the land so that they may observe how \\nwas the fate of those who were before them? They were more powerful than them, and Allah is not to \\nbe frustrated by anything in t he heavens or on the earth. Indeed, He is all -knowing, all-powerful. (44) \\nWere Allah to take humans to task because of what they have earned, He would not leave any living \\nbeing on its back. But He respites them until a specified time, and when their time comes, [He retributes \\nthem in accordance with their works], for Allah has been watching His servants. (45)'),\n",

(1) By the Wise Quran, (2) you are indeed one of the apostles, (3) on a straight path. (4) [It is a \\nscripture] sent down gradually from the All -mighty, the All -merciful (5) that you may warn a people \\nwhose fathers were not warned, s o they are oblivious. (6) The word has certainly become due against \\nmost of them, so they will not have faith. (7) Indeed We have put iron collars around their necks, which \\nare up to the chins, so their heads are upturned. (8) And We have put a barrier bef ore them and a \\nbarrier behind them, then We have blind -folded them, so they do not see. (9) It is the same to them \\nwhether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not have faith. (10) You can only warn someone \\nwho follows the Reminder and fears the Al l-beneficent in secret; so give him the good news of \\nforgiveness and a noble reward. (11) Indeed it is We who revive the dead and write what they have sent \\nahead and their effects [which they left behind], and We have figured everything in a manifest Imam.  \\n(12) Cite for them the example of the inhabitants of the town when the apostles came to it. (13) When \\nWe sent to them two [apostles], they impugned both of them. Then We reinforced them with a third, \\nand they said, ‘We have indeed been sent to you.’ (14) They said, ‘You are no other than human beings \\nlike us, and the All -beneficent has not sent down anything, and you are only lying.’ (15) They said, ‘Our \\nLord knows that we have indeed been sent to you, (16) and our duty is only to communicate in clear \\nterms.’ (17) They said, ‘Indeed we take you for a bad omen. If you do not desist we will stone you, and \\nsurely a painful punishment will visit you from us.’ (18) They said, ‘Your bad omens attend you. What! If \\nyou are admonished.... Indeed, you are an unrestra ined lot.’ (19) There came a man hurrying from the \\ncity outskirts. He said, ‘O my people! Follow the apostles! (20) Follow them who do not ask you any \\nreward and they are rightly guided. (21) Why should I not worship Him who has originated me, and to \\nwhom you shall be brought back? (22) Shall I take gods besides Him? If the All -beneficent desired to \\ncause me any distress, their intercession will not avail me in any way, nor will they rescue me. (23) \\nIndeed, then I would be in manifest error. (24) Indeed I h ave faith in your Lord, so listen to me.’ (25) He \\nwas told, ‘Enter paradise!’ He said, ‘Alas! Had my people only known (26) for what my Lord forgave me \\nand made me one of the honoured ones!’ (27) After him We did not send down on his people a host \\nfrom the sky, nor We would have sent down. (28) It was but a single Cry, and, behold, they were stilled \\n[like burnt ashes]! (29) How regrettable of the servants! There did not come to them any apostle but \\nthat they used to deride him. (30) Have they not regarded h ow many generations We have destroyed \\nbefore them who will not come back to them? (31) And all of them will indeed be presented before Us. \\n(32) A sign for them is the dead earth, which We revive and bring forth grain out of it, so they eat of it. \\n(33) We m ake in it orchards of date palms and vines, and We cause springs to gush forth in it, (34) so \\nthat they may eat of its fruit and what their hands have cultivated. Will they not then give thanks? (35) \\nImmaculate is He who has created all the kinds of what the earth grows, and of themselves, and of what \\nthey do not know. (36) A sign for them is the night, which We strip of daylight, and, behold, they find \\nthemselves in the dark! (37) The sun runs on to its place of rest: That is the ordaining of the All -mighty, \\nthe All-knowing. (38) As for the moon, We have ordained its phases, until it becomes like an old palm \\nleaf. (39) Neither it behooves the sun to overtake the moon, nor may the night outrun the day, and each \\nswims in an orbit. (40) A sign for them is that  We carried their progeny in the laden ship, (41) and We \\nhave created for them what is similar to it, which they ride. (42) And if We like We drown them, whereat \\nthey have no one to call for help, nor are they rescued (43) except by a mercy from Us and for  an \\nenjoyment until some time.

(71) And We made them tractable for them; so \\nsome of them make their mounts and some of them they eat. (72) Th ere are other benefits for them \\ntherein, and drinks.

(86) Then what is your idea about \\nthe Lord of all the worlds?’ (87) Then he made an observation of the stars (88) and said, ‘Indeed I am \\nsick!’ (89) So they went away leaving him behind. (90) Then he stole aw ay to their gods and said, ‘Will \\nyou not eat? (91) Why do you not speak?’ (92) Then he attacked them, striking forcefully. (93) They \\ncame running towards him. (94) He said, ‘Do you worship what you have yourselves carved, (95) when \\nAllah has created you an d whatever you make?’ (96) They said, ‘Build a structure for him and cast him \\ninto a huge fire.’ (97) So they sought to outwit him, but We made them the lowermost. (98) He said, \\n‘Indeed I am going toward my Lord, who will guide me.’ (99) ‘My Lord! Give me [an heir], one of the \\nrighteous.’ (100) So We gave him the good news of a forbearing son. (101) When he was old enough to \\nassist in his endeavour, he said, ‘My son! I see in dreams that I am sacrificing you. See what you think.’ \\nHe said, ‘Father! Do whatev er you have been commanded. If Allah wishes, you will find me to be \\npatient.’ (102) So when they had both surrendered *to Allah’s will+, and he had laid him down on his \\nforehead, (103) We called out to him, ‘O Abraham! (104) You have indeed fulfilled your vision! Thus \\nindeed do We reward the virtuous! (105) This was indeed a manifest test.’ (106) Then We ransomed him \\nwith a great sacrifice, (107) and left for him a good name in posterity: (108) ‘Peace be to Abraham!’ \\n(109) Thus do We reward the virtuous.

(124) Do you invoke Baal and abandon the \\nbest of creators, (125) Allah, your Lord and Lord of your forefathers?,’ (126) they impugned him.

Hasten on for us our share before the Day of Reckoning.’ (16) Be \\npatient over what they say, and remember Our servant, David, [the man] of strength. Indeed he was a \\npenitent [soul]. (17) We disposed the mountains to gl orify [Allah] with him at evening and dawn, (18) \\nand the birds [as well], mustered [in flocks]; all echoing him [in a chorus]. (19) We consolidated his \\nkingdom and gave him wisdom and conclusive speech. (20) Has there not come to you the account of \\nthe con tenders, when they scaled the wall into the sanctuary? (21) When they entered into the \\npresence of David, he was alarmed by them. They said, ‘Do not be afraid. *We are only+ two contenders: \\none of us has bullied the other. So judge justly between us, and d o not exceed [the bounds of justice], \\nand show us the right path.’ (22) ‘This brother of mine has ninety -nine ewes, while I have only a single \\newe, and *yet+ he says, ‘Commit it to my care,’ and he browbeats me in speech.’ (23) He said, ‘He has \\ncertainly wronged you by asking your ewe in addition to his own ewes, and indeed many partners bully \\none another, except such as have faith and do righteous deeds, and few are they.’ Then David knew that \\nWe had tested him, whereat he pleaded with his Lord for forgive ness, and fell down in prostration and \\nrepented. (24) So We forgave him that, and indeed he has [a station of] nearness with Us and a good \\ndestination. (25) ‘O David! Indeed, We have made you a vicegerent on the earth. So judge between \\npeople with justice,  and do not follow your desires, or they will lead you astray from the way of Allah. \\nIndeed there is a severe punishment for those who stray from the way of Allah, because of their \\nforgetting the Day of Reckoning.’ (26) We did not create the sky and the ea rth and whatever is between \\nthem in vain. That is a conjecture of the faithless. So woe to the faithless for the Fire! (27) Shall We treat \\nthose who have faith and do righteous deeds like those who cause corruption on the earth? Shall We \\ntreat the Godwary like the vicious? (28) [This is] a blessed Book that We have sent down to you, so that \\nthey may contemplate its signs, and that those who possess intellect may take admonition. (29) And to \\nDavid We gave Solomon—what an excellent servant he was! Indeed, he was a penitent [soul]. (30) One \\nevening when there were displayed before him prancing steeds, (31) he said, ‘Indeed I have preferred \\nthe love of [worldly] niceties to the remembrance of my Lord until [the sun] disappeared behind the \\n*night’s+ veil.’ (32) ‘Bring it back for me!’ Then he *and others+ began to wipe *their+ legs and necks.

(1) Indeed We have \\nsent down the Book to you with the truth; so worship Allah, putting exclusive faith in Him. (2) Indeed, \\nonly exclusive faith is worthy of Allah, and thos e who take other as awliya besides Him *claiming,+ ‘We \\nonly worship them so that they may bring us near to Allah,’ Allah will judge between them concerning \\nthat about which they differ. Indeed Allah does not guide someone who is a liar and an ingrate. (3) Had \\nAllah intended to take a son, He could have chosen from those He has created whatever He wished. \\nImmaculate is He! He is Allah, the One, the All -paramount. (4) He created the heavens and the earth \\nwith consummate wisdom. He winds the night over the day , and winds the day over the night, and He \\nhas disposed the sun and the moon, each moving for a specified term. Indeed, He is the All -mighty, the \\nAll-forgiver! (5) He created you from a single soul, then made from it its mate, and He has sent down for \\nyou eight mates of the cattle. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, in a \\nthreefold darkness. That is Allah, your Lord! To Him belongs all sovereignty. There is no god except Him. \\nThen where are you being led away? (6) If you ar e ungrateful, Allah has indeed no need of you, though \\nHe does not approve ingratitude for His servants; and if you give thanks, He approves that for you. No \\nbearer shall bear another’s burden; then your return will be to your Lord, whereat He will inform y ou \\nconcerning what you used to do. Indeed, He knows best what is in the breasts. (7) When distress befalls \\nman, he supplicates his Lord, turning to Him penitently. Then, when He grants him a blessing from \\nHimself, he forgets that for which he had supplicat ed Him earlier and sets up equals to Allah, that he \\nmay lead *people+ astray from His way. Say, ‘Revel in your ingratitude for a while. Indeed you are among \\nthe inmates of the Fire.’ (8) Is he who supplicates in the watches of the night, prostrating and st anding, \\napprehensive of the Hereafter and expecting the mercy of his Lord...? Say, ‘Are those who know equal to \\nthose who do not know?’ Only those who possess intellect take admonition. (9) Say, ‘*Allah declares:+ “O \\nMy servants who have faith! Be wary of your Lord. For those who do good in this world there will be a \\ngood *reward+, and Allah’s earth is vast. Indeed the patient will be paid in full their reward without any \\nreckoning.” ’ (10) Say, ‘I have been commanded to worship Allah with exclusive faith i n Him, (11) and I \\nhave been commanded to be the foremost of those who submit *to Him+.’ (12) Say, ‘Indeed, should I \\ndisobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a tremendous day.’ (13) Say, ‘I worship *only+ Allah, putting \\nmy exclusive faith in Him.

That is Allah’s guidance, \\nby which He guides whomever He wishes; and whomever Allah leads astray, has no gu ide. (23) What!

And the wrongdoers will be told, ‘Taste what you used to earn.’ (24) Those who were \\nbefore them impugned [the apostles], whereat the punishment overtook them whence they were not \\naware. (25) So Allah made them taste disgrace in the life of the world, and the punishment of the \\nHereafter will surely be greater, if they knew. (26) We have drawn for mankind in this Quran every [kind \\nof] example, so that they may take admonition: (27) an Arabic Quran, without any deviousness, so that \\nthey may be Godwary. (28) Allah draws an example: a man jointly owned by several contending masters, \\nand a man belonging entirely to one man: are the two equ al in comparison? All praise belongs to Allah! \\nBut most of them do not know. (29) You will die, and they [too] will die. (30) Then on the Day of \\nResurrection you will contend before your Lord. (31) So who is a greater wrongdoer than him who \\nattributes a falsehood to Allah, and denies the truth when it reaches him? Is not the [final] abode of the \\nfaithless in hell? (32) He who brings the truth and he who confirms it —it is they who are the Godwary. \\n(33) They will have what they wish with their Lord —that is the reward of the virtuous — (34) that Allah \\nmay absolve them of the worst of what they did, and pay them their reward by the best of what they \\nused to do. (35) Does not Allah suffice [to defend] His servant? They would frighten you of others than \\nHim. Yet wh omever Allah leads astray, has no guide, (36) and whomever Allah guides, there is no one \\nwho can lead him astray. Is not Allah an all -mighty avenger? (37) If you ask them, ‘Who created the \\nheavens and the earth?’ they will surely say, ‘Allah.’ Say, ‘Have y ou considered what you invoke besides \\nAllah? Should Allah desire some distress for me, can they remove the distress visited by Him? Or should \\nHe desire some mercy for me, can they withhold His mercy?’ Say, ‘Allah is sufficient for me. In Him let all \\nthe trusting put their trust.’ (38) Say, ‘O my people! Act according to your ability. I too am acting. Soon \\nyou will know (39) who will be overtaken by a punishment that will disgrace him, and on whom a lasting \\npunishment will descend.’ (40) Indeed We have sent down the Book to you with the truth for [the \\ndeliverance of] mankind. So whoever is guided is guided for his own sake, and whoever goes astray, \\ngoes astray to his own detriment, and it is not your duty to watch over them. (41) Allah takes the souls \\nat the time of their death, and those who have not died, in their sleep. Then He retains those for whom \\nHe has ordained death and releases the others until a specified time. There are indeed signs in that for a \\npeople who reflect. (42) Have they taken intercessor s besides Allah? Say, ‘What! Even though they do \\nnot control anything, and cannot reason?!’ (43) Say, ‘All intercession rests with Allah. To Him belongs \\nthe kingdom of the heavens and the earth; then you will be brought back to Him.’ (44) When Allah is \\nmentioned alone, [thereat] shrink away the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter, but \\nwhen others are mentioned besides Him, behold, they rejoice! (45) Say, ‘O Allah! Originator of the \\nheavens and the earth, Knower of the sensible and the Unseen , You will judge between Your servants \\nconcerning that about which they used to differ.’ (46) Even if the wrongdoers possessed all that is on the \\nearth, and as much of it besides, they would offer it on the Day of Resurrection to redeem themselves \\nwith it from a terrible punishment, and there will appear to them from Allah what they had never \\nreckoned. (47) The evils of what they had earned will appear to them, and they will be besieged by what \\nthey used to deride. (48) When distress befalls man, he supplic ates Us. Then, when We grant him a \\nblessing from Us, he says, ‘I was given it by virtue of *my+ knowledge.’ Indeed, it is a test, but most of \\nthem do not know.

Indeed I fear for you *a day+ like \\nthe day of the [heathen] factions; (30) like the case of the people of Noah, of Ad and Thamud, and those \\nwho came after them, and Allah does not desire any wrong for [His] servants. (31) O my  people! I fear \\nfor you a day of mutual distress calls, (32) a day when you will turn back [to flee], not having anyone to \\nprotect you from Allah, and whomever Allah leads astray has no guide. (33) Certainly Joseph brought \\nyou manifest proofs earlier, but you continued to remain in doubt concerning what he had brought you. \\nWhen he died, you said, ‘‘Allah will never send any apostle after him.’’ That is how Allah leads astray \\nthose who are unrestrained and skeptical. (34) Those who dispute the signs of Allah  without any \\nauthority that may have come to them —[that is] greatly outrageous to Allah and to those who have \\nfaith. That is how Allah seals the heart of every arrogant tyrant.’ (35) Pharaoh said, ‘O Haman! Build me \\na tower so that I may reach the routes ( 36) —the routes of the heavens —and take a look at the God of \\nMoses, and indeed I consider him a liar.’ The evil of his conduct was thus presented as decorous to \\nPharaoh, and he was kept from the way *of Allah+. Pharaoh’s stratagems only led him into ruin. (37) And \\nhe who had faith said, ‘O my people! Follow me; I will guide you to the way of rectitude. (38) O my \\npeople! This life of the world is only a [passing] enjoyment, and indeed the Hereafter is the abiding \\nhome. (39) Whoever commits a misdeed shall no t be requited except with its like, but whoever acts \\nrighteously, whether male or female, should he be faithful —such shall enter paradise, and they will be \\nprovided therein without any reckoning. (40) O my people! [Think,] what makes me invite you to \\ndeliverance, while you invite me toward the Fire? (41) You invite me to defy Allah and to ascribe to Him \\npartners of which I have no knowledge, while I call you to the All -mighty, the All -forgiver. (42) \\nUndoubtedly, that to which you invite me has no invitation in the world nor in the Hereafter, and indeed \\nour return will be to Allah, and indeed it is the transgressors who will be inmates of the Fire.

But most of them turn away [from it], [and] so they do not listen. (4) \\nThey say, ‘Our hearts are in veils *which shut them off+ from what you invite us to, and there is a \\ndeafness in our ears, and there is a  curtain between us and you. So act [as your faith requires]; we too \\nare acting *according to our own+.’ (5) Say, ‘I am just a human like you. It has been revealed to me that \\nyour God is the One God. So worship Him single-mindedly and plead to Him for forgiveness.’ And woe to \\nthe polytheists (6) —those who do not pay the zakat and disbelieve in the Hereafter. (7) As for those \\nwho have faith and do righteous deeds, there will be an everlasting reward for them. (8) Say, ‘Do you \\nreally disbelieve in Him who created the earth in two days, and ascribe partners to Him? That is the Lord \\nof all the worlds!’ (9) He set in it firm mountains, *rising+ above it, blessed it, and ordained in it, in four \\ndays, [various] means of sustenance, equally for all seekers. (10) Th en He turned to the heaven, and it \\nwas smoke, and He said to it and to the earth, ‘Come, willingly or unwillingly!’ They said, ‘We come \\nobediently.’ (11) Then He set them up as seven heavens in two days, and revealed *to the angels+ in each \\nheaven its ordi nance. We have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps, and guarded them. That is the \\nordaining of the All-mighty, the All-knowing. (12) But if they turn away, say, ‘I warn you of a thunderbolt, \\nlike the thunderbolt of ‘Ad and Thamud.’ (13) When the apostles came to them, before them and in \\ntheir own time, saying, ‘Worship no one except Allah!’ They said, ‘Had our Lord wished, He would have \\nsent down angels *to us+. We indeed disbelieve in what you have been sent with.’ (14) As for *the people \\nof+ ‘Ad, they ac ted arrogantly in the earth unduly, and they said, ‘Who is more powerful than us?’ Did \\nthey not see that Allah, who created them, is more powerful than them? They used to impugn Our signs; \\n(15) so We unleashed upon them an icy gale during ill -fated days, i n order that We might make them \\ntaste a humiliating punishment in the life of the world. Yet the punishment of the Hereafter will be \\nsurely more disgraceful, and they will not be helped. (16) As for [the people of] Thamud, We guided \\nthem, but they preferre d blindness to guidance. So the bolt of a humiliating punishment seized them \\nbecause of what they used to earn. (17) And We delivered those who had faith and were Godwary. (18) \\nThe day the enemies of Allah are marched out toward the Fire, while they are in  check, (19) when they \\ncome to it, their hearing, their eyes and their skins will bear witness against them concerning what they \\nused to do. (20) They will say to their skins, ‘Why did you bear witness against us?’ They will say, ‘We \\nwere given speech by A llah, who gave speech to all things. He created you the first time, and you are \\nbeing brought back to Him. (21) You did not use to conceal yourselves [while perpetrating sinful acts] \\nlest your hearing, your eyes, or your skins should bear witness against y ou, but you thought that Allah \\ndid not know most of what you did. (22) That misjudgement, which you entertained about your Lord \\nruined you. So you became losers.’ (23) Should they be patient, the Fire is their abode; and should they \\nseek to propitiate [All ah], they will not be redeemed. (24) We have assigned them companions who \\nmake their present [conduct] and future [state] seem decorous to them, and the word became due \\nagainst them along with the nations of jinn and humans that passed away before them. Th ey were \\nindeed losers. (25) The faithless say, ‘Do not listen to this Quran and hoot it down so that you may \\nprevail *over the Apostle+.’ (26) We will surely make the faithless taste a severe punishment, and We will \\nsurely requite them by the worst of what  they used to do.

(37) But if they disdain [the worship of Allah], those who \\nare near your Lord glorify Him night and day, and they are not wearied. (38) Among His signs, is that you \\nsee the earth desolate; but when We send down water upon it, it stirs and swells. Indeed,  He who \\nrevives it will also revive the dead. Indeed, He has power over all things. (39) Those who abuse Our signs \\nare not hidden from Us.

Indeed, it is an august Book: (41) falsehood cannot approach it, at \\npresent or in future, a [revelation gradually] sent down from One all -wise, all-laudable. (42) Nothing is \\nsaid to you except what has already been said to the apostles before you. Indeed your Lord is One who \\nforgives and also metes out a painful retribution. (43) Had We made it a non -Arabic Quran, they would \\nhave said, ‘Why have not its signs bee n articulated?’ ‘What! A non -Arabian [scripture] and an Arabian \\n*prophet+!?’ Say, ‘It is guidance and healing for those who have faith. As for those who are faithless, \\nthere is a deafness in their ears and it is lost to their sight: [to them it is as if] t hey were called from a \\ndistant place.’ (44) Certainly We gave Moses the Book, but differences arose about it; and were it not for \\na prior decree of your Lord, judgement would have been made between them, for they are in grave \\ndoubt concerning it. (45) Whoe ver acts righteously, it is for [the benefit of] his own soul, and whoever \\ndoes evil, it is to its detriment, and your Lord is not tyrannical to His servants. (46) On Him devolves the \\nknowledge of the Hour, and no fruit emerges from its covering and no fem ale conceives or delivers \\nexcept with His knowledge. On the day when He will call out to them, ‘Where are My ‘partners’?’ They \\nwill say, ‘We informed You that there is no witness amongst us.’ (47) What they used to invoke before \\nhas forsaken them, and they  know there is no escape for them. (48) Man is never wearied of \\nsupplicating for good, and should any ill befall him, he becomes hopeless and despondent. (49) If, after \\ndistress has befallen him, We let him have a taste of Our mercy, he says, ‘This is my d ue! I do not think \\nthe Hour will ever come, and in case I am returned to my Lord, I will indeed have the best [reward] with \\nHim.’ So We will surely inform the faithless about what they have done, and will surely make them taste \\na harsh punishment.

(51) Say, ‘Tell me, if it is from Allah and you disbelieve in it, who \\nwill be more astray than those who are in extreme defiance.’ (52) Soon We shall show them Our signs in \\nthe horizons and in their own souls until it becomes clear to them that He is the Real.

(39) The requital of evil is an \\nevil like it, so whoever excuses and conciliates, his reward lies with Allah. Indeed, He does not like the \\nwrongdoers. (40) As for those who retaliate after being wronged, there is no ground for action against \\nthem. (41) The ground for action is only against those who oppress the people and commit tyranny in \\nthe land in violation of justice. For such there will be a painful punishment. (42) As for someone who \\nendures patiently and forgives—that is indeed the steadiest of courses. (43) Those whom Allah leads \\nastray have no guardian apart from Him. You will see the wrongdoers, when they sight the punishment, \\nsaying, ‘Is there any way for a retreat?’ (44) You will see them being exposed to it, humbled by \\nabasement, furtively looking askance. The faithful will say, ‘Indeed the losers are those who have ruined \\nthemselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, the wrongdoers will abide in lasting \\npunishment. (45) They have no awliya to help them besides Allah. There is no way out for those whom \\nAllah leads astray.’ (46) Respond to your Lord before there comes a day for which there will be no \\nrevoking from Allah. On that day you will have no refuge, nor will you have [any chance for] denial [of \\nyour sins]. (47) But if they disregard [your warnings], [keep in mind that] We have not sent you as their \\nkeeper. Your duty is only to communicate. Indeed when We let man taste Our mercy, he boasts about it; \\nbut should an ill visit him because of what his hands have sent ahead, then man is very ungrateful. (48) \\nTo Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates whatever He wishes; He gives \\nfemales to whomever He wishes, and males to whomever He wishes, (49) or He combines them males \\nand females, and makes sterile whomever He wishes.

(1) By the Manifest Book: (2) We have made it an Arabic Quran so that you may exercise \\nyour reason, (3) and it is sublime and wise with Us in the Mother Book. (4) Shall We keep back the \\nReminder from you and disregard you because you are an unrestrained lot? (5) How many a prophet We \\nhave sent to the former peoples! (6) There did not come to them any prophet but that they used to \\nderide him. (7) So We destroyed those who were stronger than these, and the example of the former \\npeoples has already come to pass. (8) If you ask them, ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ they \\nwill surely say, ‘The All-mighty, the All-knowing created them.’ (9) He, who made the earth a cradle for \\nyou, and made for you in it ways so that you may be guided [to your destinations], (10) and who sent \\ndown water from the sky in a measured manner, and We revived with it a dead country. Likewise, you \\nshall be raised [from the dead]. (11) He created all the kinds and made for you the ships and the cattle \\nsuch which you ride, (12) that you may sit on their backs, then remember the blessing of your Lord when \\nyou are settled on them, and say, ‘Immaculate is He who has disposed this for us, and we *by ourselves+ \\nwere no match for it. (13) Indeed we shall return to our Lord.’ (14) They ascribe to Him offspring from \\namong His servants! Man is indeed a manifest ingrate. (15) Did He adopt daughters from what He \\ncreates while He preferred you with sons? (16) When one of them is brought the news of what he \\nascribes to the All-beneficent, his face becomes darkened and he chokes with suppressed rage, [and \\nsays+ (17) ‘What! One who is brought up amid ornaments and is inconspicuous in contests?’ (18) They \\nhave made the angels—who are servants of the All-beneficent—females. Were they witness to their \\ncreation? Their testimony will be written down and they shall be questioned. (19) They say, ‘Had the All-\\nbeneficent wished, we would not have worshipped them.’ They do not have any knowledge of that, and \\nthey do nothing but surmise. (20) Did We give them a Book before this, so that they are holding fast to \\nit? (21) No, they said, ‘We found our fathers following a creed, and we are indeed guided in their \\nfootsteps.’ (22) So it has been that We did not send any warner to a town before you, without its \\naffluent ones saying, ‘We found our fathers following a creed and we are indeed following in their \\nfootsteps.’ (23) He would say, ‘What! Even if I bring you a better guidance than what you found your \\nfathers following?!’ They would say, ‘We indeed disbelieve in what you are sent with.’ (24) Thereupon \\nWe took vengeance on them; so observe how was the fate of the deniers. (25) When Abraham said to \\nhis father and his people, ‘I repudiate what you worship, (26) excepting Him who originated me; indeed \\nHe will guide me.’ (27) He made it a lasting word among his posterity so that they may come back [to \\nthe right path]. (28) Indeed, I provided for these and their fathers until the truth and a manifest apostle \\ncame to them. (29) But when the truth came to them, they said, ‘This is magic, and we indeed disbelieve \\nin it.’ (30) And they said, ‘Why was not this Quran sent down to some great man from the two cities?’ \\n(31) Is it they who dispense the mercy of your Lord? It is We who have dispensed among them their \\nlivelihood in the present life, and raised some of them above others in rank, so that some may take \\nothers into service, and your Lord’s mercy is better than what they amass. (32) Were it not *for the \\ndanger] that mankind would be one community, We would have made for those who defy the All-\\nbeneficent, silver roofs for their houses and [silver] stairways by which they ascend, (33) and [silver] \\ndoors for their houses and [silver] couches on which they recline, (34) and ornaments of gold; yet all \\nthat would be nothing but the wares of the life of this world, and the Hereafter is for the Godwary near \\nyour Lord.

(40) We will indeed take vengeance \\non them, whether We take you away (41) or show you what We have promised them, for indeed We \\nhold them in Our power. (42) So hold fast to what has been revealed to you. Indeed, you are on a \\nstraight path. (43) Indeed it is a reminder for you and your people, and soon you will be questioned. (44) \\nAsk those of Our apostles We have sent before you: Did We set up any gods to be worshipped besides \\nthe All-beneficent? (45) Certainly We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his elite. He said, ‘I am \\nindeed an apostle of the Lord of all the worlds.’ (46) But when he brought them Our signs, they indeed \\nlaughed at them. (47) We did not show them a sign but it was greater than the other, and We visited on \\nthem punishment so that they might come back. (48) They would say, ‘O magician! Invoke your Lord for \\nus by the covenant He has made with you [to remove this scourge]. We will indeed be guided [when it is \\nremoved+.’ (49) But when We lifted the punishment from them, behold, they would break their pledge. \\n(50) And Pharaoh proclaimed to his people, saying, ‘O my people! Do not the kingdom of Egypt and \\nthese rivers that run at my feet belong to me? Do you not perceive? (51) Am I not better than this \\nwretch who cannot even speak clearly? (52) Why no bracelets of gold have been thrown to him, nor any \\nangels accompany him as escorts?’ (53) Thus did he mislead his people and they obeyed him. Indeed, \\nthey were a transgressing lot. (54) So when they roused Our wrath, We took vengeance on them and \\ndrowned them all. (55) Thus We made them the vanguard and an example for posterity. (56) When the \\nSon of Mary was cited as an example, behold, your people raise an outcry. (57) They say, ‘Are our gods \\nbetter or he?’ They cite him to you only for the sake of contention. Indeed, they are a contentious lot. \\n(58) He was just a servant whom We had blessed and made an exemplar for the Children of Israel. (59) \\nHad We wished We would have set angels in your stead to be [your] successors on the earth. (60) [Say,] \\n‘Indeed he is a portent of the Hour; so do not doubt it and follow me. This is a straight path. (61) Do not \\nlet Satan bar you [from the way of Allah]. Indeed he is your manifest enemy.’ (62) When Jesus brought \\nthose manifest proofs, he said, ‘I have certainly brought you wisdom, and *I have come+ to make clear to \\nyou some of the things that you differ about. So be wary of Allah and obey me. (63) Indeed Allah is my \\nLord and your Lord; so worship Him. This is a straight path.’ (64) But the factions differed among \\nthemselves. So woe to the wrongdoers for the punishment of a painful day. (65) Do they not consider \\nthat the Hour may overtake them suddenly while they are unaware? (66) On that day, friends will be \\none another’s enemies, except for the Godwary. (67) *They will be told,+ ‘O My servants! Today you will \\nhave no fear, nor will you grieve (68) —those who believed in Our signs and had been Muslims. (69) \\nEnter paradise, you and your spouses, rejoicing.’ (70) They will be served around with golden dishes and \\ngoblets, and therein will be whatever the souls desire and eyes delight in. ‘You will remain in it *forever+. \\n(71) That is the paradise you have been given to inherit for what you used to do. (72) There are \\nabundant fruits for you in it, from which you will eat.’ (73) Indeed the guilty will remain *forever+ in the \\npunishment of hell. (74) It will not be lightened for them, and they will be despondent in it. (75) We did \\nnot wrong them, but they themselves were wrongdoers. (76) They will call out, ‘O Malik! Let your Lord \\nfinish us off!’ He will say, ‘Indeed you will stay on.’ (77) ‘We certainly brought you the truth, but most of \\nyou were averse to the truth.’ (78) Have they settled on some [devious] plan?

Indeed, he was a tyrant \\namong the transgressors. (31) Certainly We chose them knowingly above all the nations, (32) and We \\ngave them some signs in which there was a manifest test.

Indeed your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that \\nabout which they used to differ. (17) Then We set you upon a clear course of the Law; so follow it, and \\ndo not follow the desires of those who do not know. (18) Indeed they will not avail you in any way \\nagainst Allah. Indeed the wrongdoers are allies of one another, but Allah is the ally of the Godwary. (19) \\nThese are eye-openers for mankind, and guidance and mercy for a people who have certainty. (20) Do \\nthose who have perpetrated misdeeds suppose that We shall treat them like those who have faith and \\ndo righteous deeds, their life and death being equal?

I \\njust follow whatever is revealed to me, and I am just a manifest warner.’ (9) Say, ‘Tell me, if it is from \\nAllah and you disbelieve in it, and a witness from the Children of Israel has testified to its like and \\nbelieved *in it+, while you are disdainful *of it+?’ Indeed Allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot. (10) \\nThe faithless say about the faithful, ‘Had it been *anything+ good, they would not have taken the lead \\nover us toward *accepting+ it.’ And since they could not find the way to it, they will say, ‘It is an ancient \\nlie.’ (11) Yet before it the Book of Moses was a guide and mercy, and this is a Book in the Arabic \\nlanguage, which confirms it, [sent] to warn the wrongdoers, and is a [bearer of] good news for the \\nvirtuous. (12) Those who say, ‘Our Lord is Allah,’ and then remain steadfast, they will have no fear, nor \\nwill they grieve. (13) They shall be the inhabitants of paradise, remaining in it [forever]—a reward for \\nwhat they used to do. (14) We have enjoined man to be kind to his parents. His mother has carried him \\nin travail, and bore him in travail, and his gestation and weaning take thirty months. When he comes of \\nage and reaches forty years, he says, ‘My Lord! Inspire me to give thanks for Your blessing with which \\nYou have blessed me and my parents, and that I may do righteous deeds which please You, and invest \\nmy descendants with righteousness. Indeed I have turned to you in penitence, and I am one of the \\nMuslims.’ (15) Such are the ones from whom We accept the best of what they do, and overlook their \\nmisdeeds, [who will be] among the inhabitants of paradise—a true promise which they had been given. \\n(16) As for him who says to his parents, ‘Fie on you! Do you promise me that I shall be raised *from the \\ndead+ when generations have passed away before me?’ And they invoke Allah’s help *and say+: ‘Woe to \\nyou! Believe! Indeed Allah’s promise is true.’ But he says, ‘These are nothing but myths of the ancients.’ \\n(17) Such are the ones against whom the word has become due, along with the nations of jinn and \\nhumans that have passed away before them. They were the losers. (18) For everyone there are degrees \\n[of merit] pertaining to what he has done: He will recompense them fully for their works, and they will \\nnot be wronged. (19) The day when the faithless are exposed to the Fire, *they will be told,+ ‘You have \\nexhausted your good things in the life of the world and enjoyed them. So today you will be requited with \\na humiliating punishment for your acting arrogantly in the earth unduly, and because you used to \\ntransgress.’ (20) And mention *Hud+ the brother of ‘Ad, when he warned his people at Ahqaf—and \\nwarners have passed away before and after him—saying, ‘Do not worship anyone but Allah. Indeed I \\nfear for you the punishment of a tremendous day.’ (21) They said, ‘Have you come to turn us away from'),\n",

(28) The word [of judgement] \\nis unalterable with Me, and I am not tyrannical to My servants.’ (29) The day when We shall say to hell, \\n‘Are you full?’ It will say, ‘Is there any more?’ (30) And paradise will be brought near for the Godwary, it \\nwill not be distant *any more+: (31) ‘This is what you were promised. *It is+ for every penitent and dutiful \\n[servant] (32) who fears the All-beneficent in secret and comes with a penitent heart. (33) Enter it in \\npeace! This is the day of immortality.’ (34) There they will have whatever they wish, and with Us there is \\nyet more. (35) How many generations We have destroyed before them, who were stronger than these, \\ninsomuch that they ransacked the towns?! So, is there any escape [from Allah’s punishment+? (36) There \\nis indeed an admonition in that for one who has a heart, or gives ear, being attentive. (37) Certainly We \\ncreated the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, in six days, and any fatigue did not \\ntouch Us. (38) So be patient at what they say, and celebrate the praise of your Lord before the rising of \\nthe sun and before the sunset, (39) and glorify Him through part of the night and after the prostrations. \\n(40) And be on the alert for the day when the caller calls from a close quarter, (41) the day when they \\nhear the Cry in all truth. That is the day of rising [from the dead]. (42) Indeed it is We who give life and \\nbring death, and toward Us is the [final] destination. (43) The day the earth is split open for \\n[disentombing] them, [they will come out] hastening. That mustering is easy for Us [to carry out]. (44)'),\n",

We disown you, and enmity and hate have appeared between you and us for \\never, unless you come to have faith in Allah alone,’ apart from Abraham’s saying to his father, ‘I will \\nsurely plead forgiveness for you, though I cannot avail you anything against Allah.’ ‘Our Lord!

Then, if you ascertain them to be [genuinely] faithful women, do not send them back to the \\nfaithless. They are not lawful for them, nor are they lawful for them, but give them what [dowry] they \\nhave spent [for them]. There is no sin upon you in marrying them when you have given them their \\ndowries. Do not hold on to [conjugal] ties with faithless women.

(4) You will see and \\nthey will see, (5) which one of you is crazy. (6) Indeed your Lord knows best those who stray from His \\nway, and He knows best those who are guided.

(9) And do not obey any vile \\nswearer, (10) scandal-monger, talebearer, (11) hinderer of all good, sinful transgressor, (12) callous and, \\non top of that, baseborn (13) —[who behaves in such a manner only] because he has wealth and \\nchildren. (14) When Our signs are recited to him, he says, ‘Myths of the ancients!’ (15) Soon We shall \\nbrand him on his snout. (16) Indeed we have tested them just as We tested the People of the Garden \\nwhen they vowed they would gather its fruit at dawn, (17) and they did not make any exception. (18) \\nThen, a visitation from your Lord visited it while they were asleep. (19) So, by dawn it was like a \\nharvested field. (20) At dawn they called out to one another, (21) ‘Get off early to your field if you have \\nto gather *the fruits+.’ (22) So off they went, murmuring to one another: (23) ‘Today no needy man shall \\ncome to you in it.’ (24) And they set out at early morning, *considering themselves] able to deprive [the \\npoor of its fruit+. (25) But when they saw it, they said, ‘We have indeed lost our way!’ (26) ‘No, it is we \\nwho have been deprived!’ (27) The most upright among them said, ‘Did I not tell you, ‘‘Why do you not \\nglorify *Allah+?’’ ’ (28) They said, ‘Immaculate is our Lord! We have indeed been wrongdoers!’ (29) Then \\nthey turned to one another, blaming each other. (30) They said, ‘Woe to us! Indeed, we have been \\nrebellious. (31) Maybe our Lord will give us a better one in its place. Indeed we earnestly beseech our \\nLord.’ (32) Such was their punishment; and the punishment of the Hereafter is surely greater, had they \\nknown. (33) Indeed for the Godwary there will be gardens of bliss near their Lord. (34) Shall We treat \\nthose who submit [to Us] as [We treat] the guilty? (35) What is the matter with you? How do you judge! \\n(36) Do you possess a scripture in which you read (37) that you shall have in it whatever you choose? \\n(38) Do you have a pledge binding on Us until the Day of Resurrection, that you shall indeed have \\nwhatever you decide? (39) Ask them, which of them will aver [any of] that! (40) Do they have any \\n‘partners’ *that they claim for Allah+? Then let them produce their partners, if they are truthful. (41) The \\nday when the catastrophe occurs and they are summoned to prostrate themselves, they will not be able \\n[to do it]. (42) With a humbled look [in their eyes], they will be overcast by abasement. Certainly, they \\nwere summoned to prostrate themselves while they were yet sound. (43) So leave Me with those who \\ndeny this discourse. We will draw them imperceptibly [into ruin], whence they do not know. (44) I will \\ngrant them respite, for My devising is indeed sure. (45) Do you ask them for a reward, so that they are \\nweighed down with debt? (46) Do they possess [access to] the Unseen, so that they write it down? (47) \\nSo submit patiently to the judgement of your Lord, and do not be like the Man of the Fish who called out \\nas he choked with grief. (48) Had it not been for a blessing that came to his rescue from his Lord, he \\nwould surely have been cast on the bare shore, being blameworthy. (49) So his Lord chose him and \\nmade him one of the righteous.

There will be no refuge! (11) That day the [final] goal will be toward your Lord. (12) That day \\nman will be informed about what [works] he had sent ahead [to the scene of judgement] and [the legacy \\nthat he had] left behind.

Indeed, you love this transitory life (20) and forsake the \\nHereafter. (21) Some faces will be fresh on that day, (22) looking to their Lord, (23) and some faces will \\nbe scowling on that day, (24) knowing that they will be dealt out a punishment breaking the spine. (25) \\nNo indeed! When it reaches up to the collar bones (26) and it is said, ‘Who will take him up?’ (27) and he \\nknows that it is the [time of] parting, (28) and each shank clasps the other shank, (29) that day he shall \\nbe driven toward your Lord. (30) He neither confirmed [the messages of Allah], nor did he pray, (31) but \\ndenied [them] and turned away, (32) and went back swaggering to his family. (33) So, woe to you! Woe \\nto you! (34) Again, woe to you! Woe to you! (35) Does man suppose that he has been abandoned to \\nfutility? (36) Was he not a drop of emitted semen, (37) and then a clinging mass? Whereat He created \\nand proportioned [him], (38) and made of him the two sexes, male and female. (39) Is not [someone \\nlike] that able to revive the dead? (40)'),\n",
